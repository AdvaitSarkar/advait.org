<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The value of computational abstractions to non-expert end-user
programmers is contentious. We study reactions to the
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> function in Microsoft Excel, which enables users to
define their own functions using the spreadsheet formula language,
through a thematic analysis of nearly 2,700 comments posted on the
Reddit, Hacker News, YouTube, and Microsoft Tech Community online
forums. We find that computational abstractions are viewed both as
helpful and harmful, that users encounter learning and understanding
barriers to applying them, and that there are deficiencies and
opportunities in tooling such as in formula editing, versioning, reuse
and sharing. We find that the introduction of <span class="lambda">lambda</span>
prompts new debate around whether spreadsheets are code, whether writing
formulas can be considered programming, and whether spreadsheet users
identify themselves as programmers.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" id="sec:introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In December 2020, the <span class="lambda">lambda</span> function was made available
to Excel spreadsheet users, enabling them for the first time to create
computational abstractions in spreadsheets, by defining new formula
functions using the language of spreadsheet formulas alone <span
class="citation"
data-cites="jones2020announcing ultimatae2021 xkcd2453">[1]–[3]</span>.</p>
<p>This development is of interest to end-user programming research
because, despite the status of the spreadsheet as the most widely-used
programming environment, no commercially dominant spreadsheet package
had implemented a language-native method for defining new functions;
prior solutions relied on parallel scripting languages. Thus, the
spreadsheet formula language remained an anomaly: the only widely-used
programming language that did not support subroutine definition since
the invention of subroutines in the 1940s <span class="citation"
data-cites="rojas2002konrad carpenter1977turing">[4], [5]</span>.</p>
<p>The limitations of the lack of a native computational abstraction in
spreadsheets are well-documented (Section <a href="#sec:background"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:background">2</a>). In
response, researchers have explored various abstraction mechanisms. The
Forms in Forms/3 spreadsheets can be invoked as subroutines <span
class="citation" data-cites="burnett2001forms">[6]</span>, and the
design of sheet-defined functions <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2003user mccutchen2020elastic">[7], [8]</span>
demonstrates the integration of such abstractions into conventional
spreadsheets. Nevertheless, such abstraction techniques were not
implemented in commercial spreadsheets.</p>
<p>To deal with these limitations, users (with sufficient expertise)
either resorted to using abstraction mechanisms offered using
alternative programming paradigms (such as VBA macros in Excel, or
Javascript custom functions in Google Sheets), or installing add-ins
which introduced new language features, or alternating between
spreadsheets and other programming languages <span class="citation"
data-cites="chalhoub2022structure">[9]</span>. Alternatively, some users
developed workaround craft practices, such as the creation of templates
for sections of grid that could be copied and pasted as self-contained
computational abstractions <span class="citation"
data-cites="joharizadeh2020gridlets">[10]</span>, or built
‘megaformulas’: elaborate formulas constructed as individual parts but
eventually ‘rolled up’ (nested) into a single cell for reuse.</p>
<p>Despite such evidence of abstractions in real-world spreadsheets, and
the promise of lambda abstractions, it is unclear <em>prima facie</em>
whether the <span class="lambda">lambda</span> construct is a net gain for end-user
programmers. For example, abstraction can make programming more
powerful, and programs more concise and intelligible; on the other hand,
they can make programs hard to understand, and poorly-considered
application of abstractions can cause problems for downstream users of
programs <span class="citation"
data-cites="blackwell2008abstract">[11]</span>.</p>
<p>The introduction of such an abstraction capability to spreadsheets
therefore raises two key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the implications of computational abstractions for the
end-user experience of spreadsheets?</p></li>
<li><p>What barriers do end-user programmers face when learning and
using abstractions, and what strategies do they employ to overcome
them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To investigate these questions, we analysed discussions from online
communities about the <span class="lambda">lambda</span> function in Microsoft Excel
(Section <a href="#sec:method" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:method">3</a>). While our analysis does not yet
answer these questions in depth, our findings identify a broad set of
phenomena, helping to map and scope further study.</p>
<p>We find several implications for the user experience of spreadsheets,
such as the potential for abstraction to help as well as hinder
comprehension, and the inadequacy of formula authoring and management
tools; we find that users encounter several barriers to applying these
abstractions and employ several strategies to address them; and we find
that computational abstractions play a crucial role in the formation of
user identities as programmers (Section <a href="#sec:results"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:results">4</a>). Thus, the
lambda abstraction in spreadsheets can either be a powerful tool, as the
golden bow of Apollo, or it can be an Achilles’ heel, weakening
comprehension and community participation.</p>
<h2 data-number="2" id="sec:background"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Background</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.1" id="the-excel-lambda-function"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Excel
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> function</h3>
<p>Lambda abstraction is a concept from the lambda calculus, introduced
by Church as a foundation for mathematics <span class="citation"
data-cites="church32 church41">[12], [13]</span>, and long considered a
foundation for programming language concepts <span class="citation"
data-cites="landin65 lambda-ultimate-imperative">[14], [15]</span>. Its
implementation in Excel is via a formula function with the same name. To
distinguish between the concept of lambda abstraction (as well as
specific instances of function values, also known as lambdas), and the
Excel function, we style the Excel function as <span class="lambda">lambda</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="lambda">lambda</span> function takes as arguments a list of
parameters followed by a formula that may refer to those parameters. For
example, the following call creates a lambda that adds two numbers:
<code>=lambda(x,y,x+y)</code>.</p>
<p>Placing such a call to <span class="lambda">lambda</span> in a cell produces an
error, because in the Excel implementation, a function value cannot be
the result of a cell. Instead, the lambda can be directly invoked
following its creation: one can write <code>=lambda(x,y,x+y)(2,3)</code>
in a cell to yield the result 5.</p>
<p>To introduce a new user-defined function using a <span class="lambda">lambda</span>
formula, a name can be assigned to the formula using the name manager.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It can then be invoked via the name.
For example, one can assign the name <code>AddNumbers</code> to
<code>=lambda(x,y,x+y)</code> and invoke it, within a cell, as
<code>=AddNumbers(2,3)</code> to yield the result 5.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2" id="abstraction-in-end-user-programming"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Abstraction in end-user
programming</h3>
<p>In the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, Green and Petre
define programming abstraction as the <em>“grouping of elements to be
treated as one entity”</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="green1996usability">[16]</span>. <em>Data</em> abstractions,
such as arrays or tables, allow us to perceive and operate on a group of
data as a single entity. <em>Control</em> or <em>computational</em>
abstractions include conditionals, loops, and subroutines.
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> functions fall into the latter category.</p>
<p>In Cognitive Dimensions terms, a notation can be abstraction-hating,
abstraction-tolerant and abstraction-hungry, based on whether it
prohibits, permits, or mandates the creation of new abstractions by the
programmer. <span class="lambda">lambda</span> takes the spreadsheet formula language
from being control abstraction-<em>hating</em> to a control
abstraction-<em>tolerant</em> language.</p>
<p>Control abstractions are difficult for end-user programmers to reason
about <span class="citation"
data-cites="blackwell2006psychological">[17]</span>. In notating
multiple possible paths of execution, they resist direct manipulation
interfaces <span class="citation"
data-cites="shneiderman1997direct">[18]</span>. Moreover, end-user
programmers avoid developing control abstractions due to the attention
investment required <span class="citation"
data-cites="blackwell2001swyn">[19]</span> and challenges when learning
and creating them <span class="citation"
data-cites="green1996usability">[16]</span>. Programming by
demonstration <span class="citation"
data-cites="kurlander1993watch">[20]</span> and programming by example
<span class="citation" data-cites="gulwani2011automating">[21]</span>
aim to address these difficulties by bridging direct manipulation and
control abstractions through inference.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3"
id="proposed-control-abstractions-in-spreadsheets"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Proposed control abstractions
in spreadsheets</h3>
<p>Sheet-defined functions (SDFs) enable users to define their own
computational abstraction using the spreadsheet formula language, much
like <span class="lambda">lambda</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2003user sestoft2013sheet">[7], [22]</span>. However,
SDFs differ from <span class="lambda">lambda</span> in that the function body can be
defined from a collection of cells, rather than a single formula.</p>
<p>A user study of SDFs found that while having a reusable abstraction
was helpful, in many cases participants preferred to view the body of
the function when invoked <span class="citation"
data-cites="mccutchen2020elastic">[8]</span>. This contrasts with the
<em>hiding</em> of the body and intermediate values that is inherent to
the user experience of subroutines. In response, Gridlets, a non-hiding
computational abstraction, has been proposed <span class="citation"
data-cites="joharizadeh2020gridlets williams2020higher">[10],
[23]</span> but not evaluated in an empirical study.</p>
<p>Another approach is to adopt practices from software development to
spreadsheet development, for better long-term maintainability of
spreadsheets. This is end-user software engineering <span
class="citation" data-cites="burnett2009euse">[24]</span>, end-user
development <span class="citation"
data-cites="costabile2006EUD">[25]</span>, or spreadsheet
engineering <span class="citation"
data-cites="grossman2007spreadsheetengg">[26]</span>. ClassSheets <span
class="citation" data-cites="cunha2010automatically">[27]</span> is an
example of an engineering abstraction developed to manage spreadsheet
complexity. End-user development research has also considered other
engineering practices such as testing <span class="citation"
data-cites="ko2011state">[28]</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.4" id="spreadsheet-abstraction-in-practice"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Spreadsheet abstraction in
practice</h3>
<p>Complex models continue to be built using spreadsheets despite the
lack of a native computational abstraction, resulting in challenges for
correctness, maintenance and auditing <span class="citation"
data-cites="panko2013end">[29]</span>. In response, spreadsheet users
have adopted various alternatives.</p>
<p>Expert users build abstractions using extensibility capabilities via
a different language; examples are VBA macros in Microsoft Excel and
JavaScript extensions in Google Sheets. Less expert users use
third-party add-ins (e.g., Ablebits<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, ASAP Utilities<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>) that provide utilities for common
tasks to augment the built-in function library. Others delegate the
development of complex spreadsheets to others with more (or different)
expertise <span class="citation"
data-cites="nardi1991twinkling">[30]</span>.</p>
<p>Users have also developed practices to manage the complexity of the
spreadsheet logic, to abstract away details and to ease comprehension
and maintenance. For example, the FAST standard<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> for
spreadsheet financial modeling recommends that formulas take no more
than 24 seconds to explain, and to move intermediate calculations to
separate sheets.</p>
<p>However, the adoption and effectiveness of such standards are
limited. There is lack of awareness, and most spreadsheet users lack
formal training. Moreover, users are not motivated to invest attention
in learning and adopting these practices. End-user programmers are
typically task-oriented, and good design is not a necessity for task
completion <span class="citation"
data-cites="ko2011state">[28]</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="3" id="sec:method"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Method</h2>
<h3 data-number="3.1" id="approach"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Approach</h3>
<p>A feature like <span class="lambda">lambda</span> can be studied in many ways. An
experiment with authoring or comprehension tasks can evince learning
barriers or usability issues, while interviews with experienced users
(if such a group could be recruited) can yield insights about
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> use and practices in users’ workflows.</p>
<p>Our motivation in this study is to observe the interaction of a broad
range of end-user programmers with <span class="lambda">lambda</span>. We were also
interested in how perceptions of a new feature like
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> can develop and evolve in discussion amongst
end-user programmers, something that is difficult to study in interview
or experimental settings.</p>
<p>We therefore opted to study discussions of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> in
online communities. Communities such as Hacker News, Twitter and GitHub
form a social ecosystem in which programmer relationships are formed and
enacted <span class="citation" data-cites="wu2014exploring">[31]</span>
and studying them <em>“can yield insights into qualitative research
topics, with results comparable to and sometimes surpassing traditional
qualitative research techniques”</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="barik2015heart">[32]</span>. Barik et al. applied this
method to investigate notions of play in programming <span
class="citation" data-cites="barik2017expressions">[33]</span>, and we
draw upon the method of that study.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, ours is the first systematic qualitative study of
online communities in spreadsheet research.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.2" id="dataset"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Dataset</h3>
<p>One researcher compiled a list of potential sources, consisting of
discussion threads matching the query “Excel Lambda” using the search
functions built into Hacker News, Reddit, Microsoft Tech Communities and
YouTube as of 20 January 2022. From the first three, we extracted
discussion threads related to “Excel Lambda”; for YouTube, the search
returns matches based on video titles and descriptions; the comments
associated with these videos were taken to be the corresponding
“threads”. Additional forum sources were inspected but not included
because they contained too few (fewer than 100) relevant comments. After
removing false positives in the threads by manual inspection, we
gathered comments from the remaining threads using automated
scripts.</p>
<p>Our final dataset, summarised in Table <a href="#tab:data"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:data">I</a>,
contained 361 distinct threads containing a total of 6999 comments
authored by 3422 distinct user IDs. In total, this corpus contains
254,541 words of discourse either directly related to
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> or occurring in a thread about <span class="lambda">lambda</span>,
with an average of 36.37 words per comment. The data spanned the time
period from 3 April 2008 through 1 February 2022. Even though a small
proportion of these comments (6.9%) were written before the initial
public release of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> on December 3, 2020, we retained
them in case any interesting observations had been made in users’
speculations about lambdas in spreadsheets.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.3" id="analysis"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Analysis</h3>
<p>We used general thematic analysis with iterative coding and codebook
development <span class="citation"
data-cites="braun2006using">[34]</span>.</p>
<p>Initially, three researchers independently open-coded the same set of
400 comments (100 comments randomly sampled from each of the four
sources). Together the researchers generated 94 proto-codes, which after
discussion and negotiations led to an initial codebook of 29 codes. The
three researchers then independently re-coded the same sample with the
codebook. Manual inspection showed poor inter-rater agreement,
consistent with initial open coding rounds in prior studies <span
class="citation" data-cites="campbell2013coding">[35]</span>.</p>
<p>The three researchers then discussed coding disagreements and
ambiguities and revised the codebook. They used the updated codebook to
independently code a fresh random sample of 200 comments (50 from each
source). The average inter-rater agreement in this round was <span
class="math inline">0.60</span> (Jaccard index). Disagreements were
negotiated, and the codebook revised.</p>
<p>The final codebook, presented in Appendix <a href="#apx:codebook"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="apx:codebook">A</a>, consisted of 28 codes;
14 code definitions were updated and 2 were merged from the initial
codebook following three rounds of negotiations between researchers.</p>
<p>Non-English comments could not be reliably interpreted by our
English-speaking research team, and several comments were not relevant
to Lambdas (e.g., “great video”). We coded these as irrelevant. These
accounted for a sizeable fraction of the data (YouTube: 62%, Reddit:
54%, Hacker News: 48%, Microsoft Tech Community: 66%). Thus the findings
presented in Section <a href="#sec:results" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:results">4</a> draw from a pool of 2697
comments.</p>
<p>With this final codebook, the dataset was divided into four sets and
one of four researchers (three being the coders from previous rounds,
the fourth an observer during previous negotiations) coded each set. As
standard validation practice <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcdonald2019reliability saldana2021coding">[36],
[37]</span>, a sample of at least 10% of code assignments made by each
researcher was audited and re-coded by another; this had an acceptably
high agreement of <span class="math inline">0.86</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers grouped codes into larger themes, discussed
overall findings and selected representative quotes.</p>
<p>Our use of inter-rater agreement is primarily as a negotiation aid,
since our findings do not hinge on frequency counts. In our analysis,
codes are the process, not the product; our findings are organised into
themes which were synthesized from these codes through the negotiation
of expert researchers. In doing so, we align with McDonald et al.’s
state-of-the-art analysis and guidelines for reliability in CSCW and HCI
research <span class="citation"

findings to our codebook, direct references to codes are presented

<p><span class="lambda">lambda</span> has several implications for the user experience
of spreadsheets. It introduces a tension between abstraction and
comprehension, and commenters propose an array of craft practices to
cope. It also exposes limitations and opportunities in tooling.
Commenters encounter barriers in learning and applying
<span class="lambda">lambda</span>, and employ a variety of strategies to deal with
these barriers. Moreover, <span class="lambda">lambda</span> leads commenters to
critically evaluate their identity as programmers. Commenters contrast
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> with alternatives to situate it within the landscape
of available tools. Finally, we observed differences in topics and
concerns between the various communities we studied. These findings are
now detailed in turn.</p>

experience of spreadsheets</h3>
<h4 data-number="4.1.1" id="the-tension-of-abstraction"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> The tension of
abstraction</h4>
<p>Abstraction is a double-edged sword and commenters seized upon this
tension. While the benefits of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> are described in
terms of improved comprehension, debugging, and maintenance, in each of
these areas commenters spotted the potential both for improvement and
regression.</p>
<p>For example, commenters noted how <span class="lambda">lambda</span> could both
improve as well as impair <strong>comprehension</strong>, especially the
readability of individual formulas.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] sometimes the excel formulas used are very long, convoluted,
and hard to grok [...] Many cells often exist as calculation cells only,
used for intermediate steps which leads to even more logic complexity.
I’m excited to experiment with these to try and simplify some of the
long, previously-deemed-necessary calculation methods. [HN<span
class="math inline"><sub>176</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>If I were to ever find someones sheet using Lambda, chances are that
I don’t know what are his values refering to [...] [YT<span
class="math inline"><sub>2021</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, commenters anticipated benefits as well as issues in
<strong>debugging, testing, and auditing</strong>.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Wow this would make my reports easier to audit as the formula is only
defined once. Plus easier [...] to read. [YT<span
class="math inline"><sub>1264</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>As a financial analyst, my primary worry is that including custom
functions will make it hard for another analyst [...] to review my
projections [...] without the ability to easily audit a LAMBDA,
financial analysts will not adopt this feature. [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>191</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Commenters postulated the implications of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> for the
<strong>maintenance</strong> of spreadsheets, in terms of not only the
modularity, but also the obfuscation they enabled.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>It should make spreadsheets smaller in size, easier to maintain,
easier to audit and easier to use. [R<span
class="math inline"><sub>49</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>I really hope that’s true, but there’s lots of potential for the
exact opposite as people cram entire programs into a single formula.
[R<span class="math inline"><sub>77</sub></span>, responding to
above.]</blockquote>
<p>In general, commenters were divided on whether <span class="lambda">lambda</span> 
functions were the Apollo’s Bow (“saving grace”) or the “Achilles’ Heel”
of spreadsheet development.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] The saving grace is that the calculation can be hidden within a
Named Lambda function [...] which is easier on the eye. [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>5</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] cells whose formulas are way too long to be put in a single
cell is Excel’s Achilles Heel (and a footgun that you are nearly
guaranteed to encounter [...]). This LAMBDA proposal as written seems to
exacerbate that problem [...]. [HN<span
class="math inline"><sub>9</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>To resolve these tensions, commenters proposed <strong>craft
practices</strong> <span class="citation"
data-cites="blackwell2018craft">[38]</span> for
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> authoring and use.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.2"
id="development-of-new-patterns-and-practices"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Development of new patterns
and practices</h4>
<p>Spreadsheet research has already documented the widespread phenomenon
of end-users and institutions advocating for development standards and
best practices, whether explicitly borrowed from software engineering or
independently reinvented. <span class="lambda">lambda</span> is no exception, prompting
discussions and suggestions about patterns and practices when authoring,
naming, commenting, and applying it.</p>
<p>Discussions on issues of authoring <span class="lambda">lambda</span> functions
included naming conventions and problem decomposition using
<span>let</span> bindings for subexpressions.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[Referring to a function named COMBINE<span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>] I added the Greek <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> simply as a flag to assist me in
reading the formulas [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>5</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>the definition of the Lambda function [...] within LET as a
locally-scoped function is something I have adopted [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>5</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Others proposed separating error handling and core logic:</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[M<span class="math inline"><sub>36</sub></span>] one approach [...]
about handling error would be to have Lambda in two layers [...] putting
the pseudo code here,<br>
MAIN = Lambda(n,IF(n&lt;&gt;int(n), "Enter integer", FIB(n))) FIB=Lambda(n,..................)
<!-- <span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{l}
    \mathsf{MAIN}=\mathsf{Lambda}(n,
    \mathsf{IF}(n\mathbin{&lt;&gt;}\mathsf{int}(n), \text{``Enter
integer"},\\
    \mathsf{FIB}(n)))
    \, \mathsf{FIB}=\mathsf{Lambda}(n, ..................)
    \end{array}$$</span> -->
</blockquote>
<p>Another example is the use of partial application to deal with
limited default parameter capabilities:</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[M<span class="math inline"><sub>9</sub></span>] you could approach
it like so:<br>
Area := LAMBDA(dim_1,LAMBDA(dim_2,dim_1*dim_2))<br><br>
<!-- <span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{l}
        \mathsf{Area}:=\mathsf{LAMBDA}(dim\_1,\mathsf{LAMBDA}(dim\_2, \\
        dim\_1*dim\_2))
    \end{array}$$</span>  -->
    
Then partially apply the 2, you get:<br> 
=Area(2) =&gt; =LAMBDA(dim_2,2*dim_2)
<!-- <span
class="math display">$$\begin{array}{l}
        {=}\mathsf{Area}(2) \, \mathbin{=&gt;} \,
{=}\mathsf{LAMBDA}(dim\_2,2*dim\_2)
    \end{array}$$</span> -->
  
</blockquote>
<p>In turn, each of the above proposals sparked questions about their
effective use. For example:</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>to what extent should I use Names for a hierarchy of Lambda functions
in order to modularise the code? [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>5</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<h4 data-number="4.1.3" id="spreadsheet-tooling-and-experience"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Spreadsheet tooling and
experience</h4>
<p>Editing and reading long formulas is already challenging <span
class="citation" data-cites="ragavan2021comprehension">[39]</span>.
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> encourages an extended, programmatic style of
formula writing that throws into sharp relief the limits of the current
formula management environment, exposing several inadequacies of
<strong>tooling</strong> and <strong>user experience</strong> for
formulas.</p>
<p>Commenters therefore drew comparisons explicitly and implicitly to
aspects of tooling well-established in the development environments of
professional programmers: syntax highlighting, multi-line editing,
parentheses matching, code completions and definitions, and version
control.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>I don’t think name manager cuts it, they’ll need a formula manager.
Comments between coding lines and tooltips are going to be necessary.
Sharing, vital [...] [YT<span
class="math inline"><sub>1045</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Functions that were developed and shared during discussions often
served a need so fundamental to some user’s work that they expressed
their desire for its inclusion in the <strong>standard function
library</strong>. Often this was motivated by the assumption that a
library function would be more performant and comprehensible than a
custom function.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Here is my upvote for the SPLIT function. I am very surprised Excel
365 did not have that as a built-in [...] [R<span
class="math inline"><sub>11</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>You should use native functions where you can. They are faster, more
stable, and just better written codes. [...] If you ever need to share
your workbook with others, they will appreciate native formula based
approach over [custom functions] that they may not understand. [R<span
class="math inline"><sub>85</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<h3 data-number="4.2" id="barriers-to-learning-and-using-lambda"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Barriers to learning and using
<span class="lambda">lambda</span></h3>
<p>Commenters encountered barriers that impaired or prevented their use
of <span class="lambda">lambda</span>. We found three out of six programming learning
barriers that Ko et al. observed <span class="citation"
data-cites="ko2004six">[40]</span>:
<strong><em>understanding</em></strong> barriers, where the
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> behaviour departed from their expectations;
<em>use</em> barriers, which stopped them authoring and applying
<span class="lambda">lambda</span>; and many instances of
<strong><em>coordination</em></strong> barriers, where users could not
combine <span class="lambda">lambda</span> with other spreadsheet features, such as
dynamic arrays. For example:</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] I cannot get even a really simple LAMBDA to work using the Name
Manager [...] [M<span class="math inline"><sub>37</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>The slip was to use the Name [...] within its own definition [...]
[M<span class="math inline"><sub>5</sub></span>, responding to
above]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>What if the LAMBDA function has two variables, then how to use these
functions? [YT<span class="math inline"><sub>1985</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] I wasn’t aware at all that the parameter name [...] I chose was
actually referring to a very distant cell name in Excel sheet. [...]
[M<span class="math inline"><sub>26</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>The causes of barriers ranged from misinterpretation of marketing
material, to lack of familiarity with programming jargon that
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> gets it name from, to mistaken assumptions about its
capabilities and intended use cases, to the differences between
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> and implementations in other programming languages
as anonymous functions.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Say I have a simple LAMBDA function := LAMBDA(number, number+1). Is
there a way to obtain the “number” by popping out an input box with a
prompt like “give me a number”? [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>14</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>you can’t use LAMBDAs like VBA to perform interactions or
manipulations of things outside the scope of the grid. [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>9</sub></span>, responding to above]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>By lambda I thought its something related to wavelength of a
frequency. [YT<span class="math inline"><sub>1828</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>To address and overcome these barriers, commenters employed a variety
of strategies. Some asked for <strong>help</strong>, or searched online
documentation. For example:</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>1. Can I save my LAMBDA to Excel so that it can be accessed in all
workbooks instead of only the workbook it was created on? 2. When my
LAMBDA is called up, can it display the parameters(syntax) the same way
a native function does? [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>35</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Others posted examples containing errors and asked others for help in
<strong>fixing the error</strong>. In debugging and repairing these
errors, commenters were able to get personalised and grounded
explanations for aspects of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> usage.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>I defined a recursive lambda [...] but received #value. Can u help to
resolve this? [M<span class="math inline"><sub>21</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Your lambda requires three parameters [...] so your reference to
itself should have 3 parameters as well. [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>9</sub></span>, responding to above]</blockquote>
<p>We observed much <strong>experimentation</strong> and hypothesising.
Commenters conducted systematic examinations of certain aspects of
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> usage, such as performance limitations, and
interactions with other spreadsheet features, and reported their
findings to the community.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>I don’t know if the rest of you love lambdas as much as I do but I
have been using them extensively [...] and would like to share one of
the tricks I have learned. [...] [R<span
class="math inline"><sub>19</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>I’m trying out excels new LAMBDA function. I’m trying to call it
recursively as they write in the press release that you would be able
to. [...] [R<span class="math inline"><sub>48</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Often, commenters were unable to completely determine the reasons for
observed behaviours, and in response developed <strong>‘folk
theories’</strong> <span class="citation"
data-cites="johnson1992basic eslami2016first devito2018people">[41]–[43]</span>
about <span class="lambda">lambda</span>, which, while possibly incorrect, facilitated
the formation of mental models that allowed commenters to reason about
the usage of <span class="lambda">lambda</span>.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] If it is actually an iterative function then it is likely to
have an underlying recursive function associated with it. The lack of
NUM error may be telling or it may simply result from the fact that
BYROWS always operates “inside LAMBDA”. The more we deal with recursive
LAMBDAS the better we will understand their underpinnings. [YT<span
class="math inline"><sub>1263</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] BYROW etc don’t seem to have the overhead that recursive
functions do. They don’t return the NUM! error. I think they’ve been
built using single vectors [...] They know when to stop in the same way
as any other formula as they always point to a defined range or array.

<p>In end-user <em>programming</em>, the focus is on completing the task

engineering</em>, the focus is on the program itself: its correctness,
maintainability, and reuse <span class="citation"
data-cites="ko2011state">[28]</span>. Discussions of
<strong>naming</strong> and <strong>reuse</strong> prompted by
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> signal a shift from the former to the latter.</p>
<p><span class="lambda">lambda</span> definitions provoke end-user consideration of
naming conventions because, notwithstanding a trivial invocation, names
are compulsory arguments to <span>let</span> and <span class="lambda">lambda</span>. A
key reason for the approachability of spreadsheet programming is the
<em>lack</em> of a forced consideration of naming: grid references
provide automatic names for variables; to instantiate a variable the
user needs only enter a value or a formula – the act of choosing a grid
location subsumes the act of naming. While assigning names to grid
ranges is supported through the name manager, only a small fraction of
spreadsheet users know of the feature, let alone use it <span
class="citation" data-cites="sarkar2018calculation">[44]</span>. Thus,
this discussion could only have been precipitated by <span>let</span>
and <span class="lambda">lambda</span>.</p>

class="math inline"><sub>1218</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, until the introduction of <span class="lambda">lambda</span>, users had
to learn a different programming language (e.g., VBA, JavaScript) to
define functions, and organizational IT teams often restrict their use
over security concerns (Section <a href="#sec:alternatives"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:alternatives">4.5</a>).
The capabilities of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> leads to speculations about

<h3 data-number="4.4" id="identity-formation"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Identity formation</h3>
<p>The computational nature of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> raised discussions
regarding the identity of spreadsheet users as programmers,
<strong>spreadsheets as code</strong>, and the expertise required to
harness <span class="lambda">lambda</span>. One perspective distinguished spreadsheet
authoring and programming, similarly viewing <span class="lambda">lambda</span> as a
separate to coding.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>That’s true if you know VB. Most Excel users don’t and this is a
simple method to build complex functions without having to code.
[YT<span class="math inline"><sub>421</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Many people that use Excel are office workers and don’t have enough
background in programming or the time to learn it. You can pick up the
LAMBDA function in a few minutes though if you are already familiar with
many other Excel functions. [YT<span
class="math inline"><sub>421</sub></span>] 
</blockquote>
Prior work suggests that this
perspective can be motivated by wanting to distance oneself from a
“programmer” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hermans2016spreadsheets">[45]</span>. This tension of
identity was also reflected in the discussion.
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Whilst [...] Lambda functions are simple extensions of the
traditional spreadsheet methods [...] the process of solution
development shifts from the ad-hoc to being a programming exercise [...]
traditional methods allow users to interact with their numbers whilst
remaining in denial that they are actually programming [M<span
class="math inline"><sub>5</sub></span>]</blockquote>

The <strong>expertise</strong>
required to use <span class="lambda">lambda</span> was another common theme. Central to
the discussion was the notion of expertise across an organization,
particularly the practice of those with expertise building and
<strong>sharing</strong> solutions with those who do not. Some viewed
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> as another advanced feature reserved for those with
expertise.
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Most organizations [...] only have a couple people who can actually
make and edit the advanced sheets [...] and lots of people who use those
sheets with a very, very rudimentary knowledge of Excel to generally get
their jobs done. I don’t really see the addition of new advanced
functionality changing that [...] [HN<span
class="math inline"><sub>38</sub></span>] </blockquote>

Several users expressed
reluctance or concerns because collaborators might not be familiar with
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> functions; thus, <span class="lambda">lambda</span> functions might
hinder comprehension.
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] though how might non-technical folks feel about a coworker
sending them a spreadsheet with function-values? [HN<span
class="math inline"><sub>4</sub></span>] </blockquote>

In contrast, others indicated
that <span class="lambda">lambda</span> can improve sharing by providing a way to
implement advanced functionality without resorting to traditional
programming such as VBA, reaffirming that some users perceive a
distinction between spreadsheets and code.
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>There’s always been this midpoint of complexity when making
spreadsheets that coworkers will use. Including macros scares them away
but using long, un-named formulas does not even though it is much less
clear what it’s doing [...] a macro was not needed, only a label and
some arguments to lower the cognitive load. [HN<span
class="math inline"><sub>95</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Consistent with prior observations, we observed derision and
gatekeeping behaviour regarding the identity and expertise of
spreadsheet users as programmers <span class="citation"
data-cites="hermans2016spreadsheets">[45]</span>.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>What has instead happened, I shit you not, is we have “Excel

<blockquote>[...] The irony is that this feature will almost certainly be met
with derision &amp; scorn from the CS crowd and clueless shrugs from
excel users. [HN<span class="math inline"><sub>182</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>However, we also observed the championing and support for the
perspective that spreadsheet users are part of a programming
community.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>Of course this also means that Excel becomes even more of a slippery
slope towards programming generally, which can only be a good thing.
[HN<span class="math inline"><sub>161</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>[...] this could actually be a really natural bridge into programming
for a lot of people whose advanced Excel skills already have them on the
cusp. [HN<span class="math inline"><sub>119</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p>Debate about the identity of spreadsheet users as programmers is by
no means new <span class="citation"
data-cites="hermans2016spreadsheets">[45]</span>, but the introduction
of a first-class computational abstraction is a fresh opportunity for
users and researchers alike to revisit this discussion.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.5" id="sec:alternatives"><span
class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Alternatives</h3>
<p>Discussions of potential <strong>alternatives</strong> to
<span class="lambda">lambda</span>, including other ways of achieving the same thing as
<span class="lambda">lambda</span>, or simply citations of other technologies, helped
users situate <span class="lambda">lambda</span> among a wider suite of tools. The most
common comparison was to VBA. Users discussed other programming
languages, software packages, and alternative ways of using existing
spreadsheet features.</p>
<p>After expertise, which we have covered, the salient axes of
comparison were <strong>security</strong> and
<strong>performance</strong>. When contrasted with VBA macros,
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> was seen to have security and performance benefits,
due to the perceived superiority of the formula calculation engine over
the VBA environment.</p>

<blockquote>Alternatively, Excel lambda-based udfs will be faster than VBA UDFs
because the Excel Calc engine is multi-threaded, whereas VBA is
single-threaded. [R<span class="math inline"><sub>21</sub></span>]</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lambdas also have the advantage of working in situations where macros
are not allowed or on platforms where VBA is not available [...] though
the latter also allows you to perform many workbook management tasks.
[YT<span class="math inline"><sub>909</sub></span>]</blockquote>
<p><em></em></p>
<blockquote>The problem with “macros” is that they can be arbitrary VBA code that
can invoke OS functions and foreign applications. Lambdas can only
invoke Excel functions that you can invoke anyway [...] Lambdas merely
add an abstraction mechanism, they otherwise don’t provide access to new

<h3 data-number="4.6" id="differences-in-communities"><span
class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Differences in communities</h3>
<p>We observed differences between the four communities studied,
reflective of the differing demographics of users of these websites and
their differing concerns. Together, they showcase a diverse range of
stakeholder perspectives.</p>
<p>For example, Hacker News, a community aimed towards technology
industry professionals, involved comparative and analytical comments
that considered the reception and consequences of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> on
the spreadsheet community. Comments from Hacker News were the longest on
average (median=47 words), in part because they explored technical
concepts. Many drew comparisons with programming concepts, research that
inspired <span class="lambda">lambda</span>, potential improvements based on other
programming paradigms, or whether using spreadsheets constituted
programming.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Microsoft Tech Community is the official
discussion and help forum for Microsoft products, including Excel. Users
fell largely into two groups: a small number of experts who contributed
to several threads, and a large number of users who came to seek help,
started a single thread, and posted only a few comments on it. Comments
were somewhat long (median=44 words) and often included formulas and
attached spreadsheets. This can be seen in the high occurrence of
<strong>use intent</strong> and <strong>experimentation</strong>, both
of which relate to users writing examples of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> 
(Fig. <a href="#fig:source_diffs" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:source_diffs">1</a>).</p>
<p>Reddit discussions were more concerned with sharing
<strong>craft</strong> practices. Most threads came from the
<code>r/excel</code> forum, which is focused on sharing techniques and
news, and oriented towards practitioners and enthusiasts. Reddit
comments discussed naming and commenting, how to use
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> to improve maintainability and comprehension, and
pitfalls to avoid. Reddit users appeared to have a wide range of
expertise. Some had formal knowledge of programming, although a smaller
proportion than Hacker News.</p>
<p>YouTube comments were often in response to tutorial videos, which
users presumably watched to learn about <span class="lambda">lambda</span>. Our YouTube
data contained more unique users and comments than the other three
sources combined, but its comments were also the shortest (median=13
words), and often not informative. YouTube comments often reflected
users’ unjustified <strong>sentiment</strong> towards
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig:source_diffs"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:source_diffs">1</a>).</p>
<p>To illustrate the differences, we present the relative frequency of
codes across different communities in Figure <a href="#fig:source_diffs"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:source_diffs">1</a>. We
recognise inherent limitations in attempting to quantify qualitative
codes, and present this purely as an narrative aid. We are not making

<h3 data-number="5.1" id="are-spreadsheet-users-programmers"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Are spreadsheet users
programmers?</h3>
<p>The question of whether spreadsheet users are programmers is not
inconsequential terminological hair-splitting; it has implications for
the role spreadsheets play in society.</p>
<p><em>Programmer</em> is a marked identity <span class="citation"
data-cites="brekhus1998sociology">[46]</span> with cultural associations
against which end-users judge themselves. The conceptualisation of
spreadsheet use as a programming activity therefore directly suggests to
users whether spreadsheets are for people ‘like them’ or for ‘others’.
People’s skills are shaped and captured by software, resulting in an
intimate binding of one’s professional value to the software one uses
<span class="citation"
data-cites="nouwens2018application">[47]</span>.</p>
<p>It has been previously observed that spreadsheet users do not view
themselves as programmers <span class="citation"
data-cites="hermans2016spreadsheets">[45]</span>. Our findings provide
additional nuance: some spreadsheet users view themselves as
programmers, but others do not. Some are unaware that a distinction can
be made, or if a distinction is to be made, what the appropriate grounds
are. Users who concede that spreadsheet formula authoring can be viewed
as programming may nonetheless not self-identify as programmers.</p>
<p>boyd and Ellison describe the community process of <em>impression
management</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="boyd2007social">[48]</span>, where the expression of self
through social media becomes a mechanism for forming and signalling
identity. Though highly individualised, the identity of “programmer” is
at the same time a community identity, subject to community negotiation.
In this respect it is similar to sociological theories of group
formation <span class="citation"
data-cites="litwak1969primary">[49]</span>. Kinship, friendship, and
neighbourly groups serve as means of allocating resources, but also as a
psychological device for uniting the sense of self with a sense of
belonging. Thus, the use and discussion of <span class="lambda">lambda</span> can serve
both as a peer-signalling mechanism as well as to enact one’s own
identity as a programmer.</p>
<p><span class="lambda">lambda</span> creates new bridges (and gulfs) between
programmers and ‘others’. Many commenters implied that using
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> is closer to traditional notions of programming than
authoring spreadsheet formulas, but it is unclear what underpins this
perception. Does managing complexity via <span class="lambda">lambda</span> resemble
software engineering practices, associated with programming and
dissociated from spreadsheets? As Wing notes, decomposition and
abstraction are key to computational thinking <span class="citation"
data-cites="wing2006computational">[50]</span>.</p>
<p>Some commenters predicted that <span class="lambda">lambda</span> is going to change
the way spreadsheets are built. However, absent better tooling and
higher levels of user expertise, it is doubtful whether a
<span class="lambda">lambda</span>-centric spreadsheet development approach induces
better design, testing, or documentation. While some users anticipated a
“structural revolution”, such optimism ought to be tempered by the fact
that formula writers constitute a minority of spreadsheet users, and
corpus studies show that as few as 7% of spreadsheets contain a single
formula <span class="citation"
data-cites="hermans2015enron barik2015fuse">[51], [52]</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.2" id="abstraction-and-comprehension"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Abstraction and
comprehension</h3>
<p>Ragavan et al.’s study of spreadsheet comprehension found two main
bottlenecks to formula comprehension: first, the information-seeking
detours required to understand the quantities on which a formula
operates; and second, understanding the usage of unfamiliar formula
functions <span class="citation"
data-cites="ragavan2021comprehension">[39]</span>.</p>
<p>While some commenters felt that <span class="lambda">lambda</span> improved formula
comprehension, particularly regarding ‘megaformulas’, others felt that
these problems would be worsened. Ragavan et al.’s findings allow us to
identify the source of this contradiction: first, the naming of
subexpressions can either eliminate or necessitate information-seeking
detours; and second, with <span class="lambda">lambda</span>, there is both the
potential for more intelligible, domain-specific functions as well as
for arbitrary, poorly-documented constructions. The resolution of this
tension cannot be (purely) in the technical design of the formula
language, and thus we observed users develop craft practices in
response.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.3"
id="implications-for-spreadsheets-and-other-tools"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Implications for spreadsheets
and other tools</h3>
<p><span class="lambda">lambda</span> promotes attention investment in complex
formulas, and thus raises issues of tooling. Discussions made clear the
value of ideas from professional development environments, such as
syntax highlighting, code definitions, autocomplete, versioning and
library management, and so on. We are not the first to observe such
needs or propose their implementation. However the wholesale
implementation of professional features for end-user programmers is
seldom an effective strategy; the design of Calculation View <span
class="citation" data-cites="sarkar2018calculation">[44]</span> shows
how a code-like representation might be sympathetically introduced as a
companion to the spreadsheet grid.</p>
<p>Opportunities also arise for misuse. Common anti-patterns in
programming (e.g., abuse of recursion, deeply nested conditions, deep
chains of invocations) may surface through <span class="lambda">lambda</span>.
Opportunities emerge for educating spreadsheet users about such misuses,
and for addressing them (e.g., via refactoring tools <span
class="citation" data-cites="hermans2015detecting">[53]</span>). By
analogy to prior research, there are research opportunities in unit
testing and documentation <span class="citation"
data-cites="ko2011state">[28]</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.4" id="limitations"><span
class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Limitations</h3>
<p>Analyses of online communities are subject to self-selection bias;
participation in our dataset is skewed towards end-user programmers with
an intrinsic interest in <span class="lambda">lambda</span> and in developing their
technical skills. This group may not be representative. On the other
hand, attitudes and practices of spreadsheet use often percolate through
the end-user community via influential, opinionated, and expert
individuals who advocate for features and techniques <span
class="citation"
data-cites="sarkar2018people brancheau1990adoption">[54], [55]</span>.
As such, it seems advantageous to study a group whose views are likely
to influence others.</p>
<p>During coding, we felt limited by our <em>unitisation</em> of the
data into individual comments. Sometimes codes were more properties of
(sub-)threads than of individual comments. There were digressive and
discursive comments which, despite arising in the context of one set of
codes, were not directly relevant to them. We developed heuristics for
consistency (e.g., to qualify for a code, a reply must add new
information and not merely repeat or agree with a previous comment) but
still felt the need for a more flexible scheme than applying codes to
individual comments. While in this study we followed the single-comment
model of previous work <span class="citation"
data-cites="barik2017expressions">[33]</span>, this strikes us as an
area with potential for methodological innovation.</p>
<p>Our data captures an early stage of the <span class="lambda">lambda</span> release,
with access limited for most of this period to a public beta testing
program (albeit a very large one, with millions of members). We could
have waited until <span class="lambda">lambda</span> had been in general release for
some time. However, observations of user experiences at all stages of a
product lifecycle are useful; documenting early barriers and
misconceptions will enable comparisons with user attitudes in the
future.</p>
<h2 data-number="6" id="sec:conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion and future work</h2>
<p>We studied reactions to lambda abstractions in spreadsheets through a
thematic analysis of nearly 2,700 comments posted on four online forums.
Commenters noted that abstraction has both benefits and drawbacks, and
that complementary practices (e.g., variable naming, documentation) and
better tooling (e.g, editors, sharing and versioning tools, testing and
debugging utilities) are necessary to use
<span class="lambda">lambda</span> effectively. They also anticipated challenges around
comprehension by less-expert users. <span class="lambda">lambda</span> prompted mindset
changes towards investing in authoring more reusable abstractions.</p>
<p>The Excel <span class="lambda">lambda</span> function reopens debate around the
identity of spreadsheet users as programmers. It raises questions of
whether users ought to learn a ‘traditional’ programming language to
access concepts such as abstraction and recursion, and whether lambda
abstractions are a smooth segue for spreadsheet users to begin learning
a language such as Python. Each of these opens a rich avenue for future
work.</p>
