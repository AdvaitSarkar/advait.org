<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular generative models,
are transformative tools for knowledge work. They problematise notions
of creativity, originality, plagiarism, the attribution of credit, and
copyright ownership. Critics of generative models emphasise the reliance
on large amounts of training data, and view the output of these models
as no more than randomised plagiarism, remix, or collage of the source
data. On these grounds many have argued for stronger regulations on the
deployment, use, and attribution of the output of these models.</p>
<p>However, these issues are not new or unique to artificial
intelligence. In this position paper, using examples from literary
criticism, the history of art, and copyright law, I show how creativity
and originality resist definition as a notatable or
information-theoretic property of an object, and instead can be seen as
the property of a process, an author, or a viewer. Further alternative
views hold that all creative work is essentially reuse (mostly without
attribution), or that randomness itself can be creative. I suggest that
creativity is ultimately defined by communities of creators and
receivers, and the deemed sources of creativity in a workflow often
depend on which parts of the workflow can be automated.</p>
<p>Using examples from recent studies of AI in creative knowledge work,
I suggest that AI shifts knowledge work from material production to
critical integration. This position paper aims to begin a conversation
around a more nuanced approach to the problems of creativity and credit
assignment for generative models, one which more fully recognises the
importance of the creative and curatorial voice of the users of these
models, and moves away from simpler notational or information-theoretic
views.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In October 2022, creators using AI-generated art faced fierce
opposition, including death threats, from the manga community in Japan
<span class="citation" data-cites="deck_2022">[43]</span>, because the
art strongly mimicked the styles of well-known manga artists, clearly
enabled by the use of copyrighted illustrations in the training data.
The Japanese anime and manga industries have long been accepting of fan
art that directly reuses copyrighted work, and to some extent even
encourages it, as it stimulates engagement with the franchise. But using
AI to generate this artwork seemed to cross a line. It seemed to push
beyond the limit of cultural acceptability. Something about the nature
of mechanical production signals a shift in our relationship with
creativity and knowledge work.</p>
<p>To begin to unpick this shift, we need a clearer articulation of
creativity. This we can get from Margaret Boden <span class="citation"
data-cites="boden_2007">[19]</span>, for whom a creative idea is
surprising, novel, and valuable.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> An idea may be novel
with respect to the individual person (“P-creativity”) or with respect
to a historical community (“H-creativity”). It is either the production
of a novel (and surprising, and valuable) idea from within a pre-defined
conceptual space, or the transformation of conceptual space to enable
new forms of idea.</p>
<p>Blackwell develops this definition by observing that “surprise” can
be defined in information-theoretic terms <span class="citation"
data-cites="blackwell2022coding">[15]</span>. The information content of
a message is a measure of how surprising it is; a message that is not
surprising at all provides no new information. Moreover, drawing on
Dennett’s notion of the intentional stance <span class="citation"
data-cites="dennett1971intentional">[44]</span>, Blackwell argues that
even when AI produces something surprising, novel, and valuable, it
cannot be creative, because that would incorrectly assume that the model
itself has beliefs, goals, and desires. In other words, it cannot be
creative because it is not <em>intentional</em>. It would thus be
incorrect to attribute creativity to the model, as it would be incorrect
to attribute the capacity for arithmetic to a calculator <span
class="citation" data-cites="collins1998shape">[35]</span>. Rather, any
creativity in this instance arises from the human activity of
constructing a “performance” on the basis of this random output, as a
Tarot card reader produces a creative performance on the basis of a
randomised arrangement of cards.</p>
<p>Moreover, Blackwell argues that the stochastic reuse of training
data, even when arranged into novel forms, is not a truly novel idea; it
is the execution and replay of human behaviour encoded into these
systems. It is a form of objectivity laundering <span class="citation"
data-cites="blackwell2020objective">[16]</span>, where inherently
subjective human judgements are replayed in an algorithmically
objectified manner. Yet these “stochastic parrots” <span
class="citation" data-cites="bender2021dangers">[10]</span>, as Gebru,
Bender, et al. term them, cannot be extricated from the subjective
biases inherent in their training data. With this view of AI as
mechanical replay of subjective judgements, Sarkar argues that the
phrase “human-AI collaboration” ought to be avoided, because it implies
that AI is a creative collaborator, responsible for a certain share of
labour, rather than those who provided the training data, who are the
true collaborators in any human-AI “collaboration” <span
class="citation" data-cites="sarkar2023enough">[120]</span>.</p>
<p>With these precepts in place, it is possible to assess the creativity
or plagiaristic nature of AI with respect to its training data and with
respect to the wider world of information content. When an AI system
repeats a sentence (or image, etc.) from its training data, it is not
creative because it does not fulfil the criterion for new information,
and it is a plagiarist because it can do so without attribution. When it
repeats an idea or ideology from its training data, albeit in a unique
and novel way, it is not creative because that idea derives from
behaviour exemplified in the training set, and it may still be a
plagiarist if it is the intellectual content of the idea and not the
words used to describe it (or image used to depict it, etc.) that we
consider to be original intellectual property <span class="citation"
data-cites="lee2022language">[83]</span>. And when it produces a
genuinely novel, surprising, and valuable idea, it may not be a
plagiarist, but it cannot be considered creative because to do so would
be to take an intentional stance.</p>
<p>There is extensive commentary on the nature of computers and
creativity, far too much to include in this brief introduction (indeed
practically every paper published in the long-running ACM conference on
Creativity &amp; Cognition<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is a candidate for
inclusion). There are relevant reviews of the field <span
class="citation"
data-cites="anantrasirichai2022artificial boden2008computers frich2018twenty wang2017literature">[4,
18, 52, 138]</span>. However I hope to have captured the salient points
germane to the discussion of the current generation of artificial
intelligence, primarily foundation models and large language models.
These have been articulated by Boden, Blackwell, Bender, Dennett, Gebru,
Sarkar, etc. as follows: creativity is information-theoretic surprise,
with authorial intent. AI systems generate content through randomised
reuse without intent or attribution; they are therefore not creative and
tend to facilitate plagiarism. The danger is clear: integrating these
systems into everyday knowledge workflows (writing documents, creating
graphics, etc.) is likely to lead to a collective loss of creativity, an
increase in mechanised plagiarism, and “undermining creative economies”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="weidinger2021ethical">[140]</span>.</p>
<p>These are valid, important, and logical perspectives on creativity
and plagiarism. My aim in this paper is not to dismantle or refute them.
However, I am concerned that these perspectives only represent a small
fraction of the plurality of perspectives on creativity and plagiarism,
all of which are equally valid, important, and logical. In this paper, I
will show with examples the following alternative perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Process as creativity: that creativity lies not in the object of
creation, but in the method of production (Section <a
href="#sec:process" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:process">2.1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Authorial intent and discourse as creativity: that the creative
content of an object can only be understood with respect to the author’s
intent, or the societal discourse surrounding it (Section <a
href="#sec:authorial_intent" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:authorial_intent">2.2</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretation as creativity: that creativity is not a property
of an object but of the interaction between a reader and the object
(Section <a href="#sec:interpretation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:interpretation">2.3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Reuse as creativity: that reuse of prior material without
attribution is an unavoidable aspect of any creative endeavour
(Section <a href="#sec:reuse" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:reuse">2.4</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Randomness as creativity: that random processes can be viewed as
creative of their own accord, especially as a mechanism to distance the
(human) creator from the creation (Section <a href="#sec:randomness"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:randomness">2.5</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After discussing these perspectives, I will explain how the
form-content distinction becomes a recurrent issue in creativity
(Section <a href="#sec:form_content" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:form_content">3</a>), and the challenges of relying
on intellectual property law to help understand whether AI is being
creative (Section <a href="#sec:intellectual_property"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:intellectual_property">4</a>).</p>
<p>Each perspective raises several questions and harbours its own
contradictions and ethical shortcomings. Answering these questions and
resolving these contradictions is impossible; it is precisely the
impossibility of this task that has given rise to such a plurality of
perspectives. However impossible, the exercise is not futile. The result
of considering these perspectives will be a new agenda for understanding
how creativity in knowledge work is affected by AI, namely, as a shift
from the direct production of knowledge artefacts to the <em>critical
integration</em> of AI output as part of a broader knowledge workflow
(Section <a href="#sec:AI_natures" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:AI_natures">5</a>).</p>
<p>To clarify the scope of this paper, it is worth briefly discussing
what is meant by AI, what is meant by knowledge work, and what is the
relationship between creativity and knowledge work. First, “AI”. AI is a
broad term that encompasses an unusually diverse, heterogenous, and
multidisciplinary set of concepts, stretching back over two centuries
<span class="citation" data-cites="mackenzie2017machine">[91]</span>.
When the term “AI” is used in this paper, it is referring to
contemporary, statistical, deep learning approaches which use vast
numbers of parameters and quantities of training data to model a space
of knowledge artefacts (e.g., images, texts) and can be used to generate
artefacts by sampling from this space. These include foundation models
<span class="citation"
data-cites="bommasani2021opportunities">[21]</span>, large language
models <span class="citation"
data-cites="brown2020language">[26]</span>, image generation models
<span class="citation" data-cites="ramesh2021zero">[116]</span>, among
others. These are often referred to collectively as “generative AI”.</p>
<p>Next, “knowledge work”. This term was popularised by Peter Drucker
<span class="citation" data-cites="drucker1959">[46]</span>, for whom
knowledge work was differentiated from manual work by its focus on
applying mental faculties and knowledge acquired through systematic
education. In this paper, I further refine the scope of the term by
adopting the key property identified by Kidd <span class="citation"
data-cites="kidd1994marks">[79]</span>, namely that knowledge work
requires the private transformation of the individual doing the work, as
an outcome of processing information. I further focus on those
particular aspects of knowledge workflows that culminate in the
production of material artefacts such as documents, textual
communication, images, presentations etc., upon which there is a
cultural or corporate expectation of creativity (as per Boden’s
criteria). These production-oriented tasks are directly affected by the
AI technologies under discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, how does creativity relate to knowledge work? In some sense,
the need for creativity in knowledge work falls out implicitly from the
joint definitions of Boden and Kidd: in order to be usefully transformed
by information processing, a knowledge worker must synthesize a novel
idea. This process of synthesis is depicted by Wallas’ multi-stage model
of creativity <span class="citation"
data-cites="wallas1926art">[137]</span>. Not all aspects of all
knowledge work might be considered creative, and a notion of creativity
may rather be dependent on individual and group norms, as Xu et al.
argue <span class="citation" data-cites="xu2023creativity">[145]</span>.
In this paper, rather than attempt to draw examples from the academic
discourse on creativity in knowledge work, we will look at the discourse
on creativity in literature, music, and art (among other fields). These
are forms of knowledge work in which the concerns around creativity are
acutely and deeply rooted, and consequently the discussion of creativity
is particularly rich and nuanced. Each section will conclude with a
reflection on how this discussion relates to the issues of AI and
creativity in knowledge work more broadly.</p>
<h2 data-number="2" id="alternative-conceptions-of-creativity"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Alternative conceptions of
creativity</h2>
<p>The current discourse around AI creativity and plagiarism focuses on
the information content of its output. In particular, its output is
measured and qualified in terms of familiar units of information:
tokens, words, bits, or pixels. This information content is considered
the primary or only determinant of the creativity of the output.</p>
<p>However, there are alternative views of creativity which
de-emphasise, or even ignore, the actual content of any objects produced
as part of a creative process. These views move away from
<em>content</em> and towards <em>context</em>. Sometimes, it is the
process itself which is considered creative, and the resultant objects
are incidental. Sometimes, an object can be viewed as creative or
un-creative depending on the authorial intent and the social discourse
which accompanies it, or the way in which it is interpreted by the
viewer. Creativity may not be defeated by reuse, but entirely dependent
on it. Random processes may themselves be sources of creativity. This
section explains each of these views in turn.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1" id="sec:process"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Process as creativity</h3>
<p>The artistic practice of conceptual art emphasises the process of
creating an artwork, and de-emphasises the resultant artefact <span
class="citation" data-cites="lewitt1967paragraphs">[88]</span>. In
conceptual art, according to LeWitt, <em>“all of the planning and
decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair.
The idea becomes a machine that makes the art”</em>. Conceptual artists
proceed by experimentation, sketching, and extensive prototyping, until
arriving at a method for executing or expressing an idea. This method
can be executed once, or many times, but it is itself the true outcome
of the creative process, not any particular execution. Seeking a
complete separation between process and outcome, some practitioners
proceeded <em>“by making plans for their work and having these plans
executed by others [...] not simply by describing a desired image, but
by specifying the process by which the work was to be made”</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="galenson2011old">[54]</span>.</p>
<p>The ideology of conceptual art was prefigured in abstract
expressionism, in particular “action painters” like Pollock and Gorky,
who emphasised the bodily motion and physicality of the art process as
essential to the content of the artwork. According to Froman <span
class="citation" data-cites="froman1988action">[53]</span>, action
painting shifts <em>“from painting where [...] the artist paints toward
the goal of an image [...] to painting where the artist comes to the
canvas as a site for acting, so that the painting displays the event
that takes place when the artist paints”</em>. It was anticipated
perhaps earlier still in Brutalist architecture, which sought to expose
and exalt materials and construction processes, producing
<em>“structures which were entirely visible, reducing historical
ornament to a minimum so that the exterior could reflect the inner
structure rather than hiding it”</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="clement2018brutalism">[34]</span>.</p>
<p>Conceptual art has a cognate practice in literature: conceptual
writing <span class="citation" data-cites="acker2011against">[1]</span>.
Conceptual writers proceed by writing with constraints (deriving from
the OuLiPo movement <span class="citation"
data-cites="james2009constraining">[74]</span>), or under a set of
generative rules. Many work with computer programs, or write programs to
facilitate the mechanised execution of writing rules (as in generative
art <span class="citation"
data-cites="boden2009generative">[20]</span>). The processes and rules
are anterior to the generated texts, and are considered the objects in
which creativity resides.</p>
<p>Computing gives us a ready metaphor for this view. We are already
accustomed to thinking of algorithms as distinct creative contributions
from any particular “run” of the algorithm with a certain input and
output. Quicksort is a creative contribution distinct from mergesort or
bubblesort, despite the fact that every correct sorting algorithm
produces the same output as any other.</p>
<p>In a review of generative art practices, Boden and Edmonds point out
that it is difficult to pinpoint the “locus of creativity”, whether it
is in the individual artwork, or in the “art system” <span
class="citation" data-cites="boden2009generative">[20]</span>. This is
not a question that can be logically answered from first principles, but
is continuously renegotiated by communities of art producers and
consumers. If in a particular context, creativity is viewed as a
property of the process and not the outcome, whether AI is being
creative or a plagiarist rests not on its output but rather whether its
algorithm, or the human-AI-data complex which comprises the creational
“algorithm”, can be understood as distinct from or identical to
another.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2" id="sec:authorial_intent"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Authorial intent and discourse
as creativity</h3>
<p>In 1917 Marcel Duchamp signed a porcelain urinal and submitted it for
an exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists. In doing so, he is
credited with creating the single most influential work of modern art
<span class="citation" data-cites="higgins_2004">[68]</span>. Though
<em>Fountain</em> was not Duchamp’s first work repurposing ordinary
materials, and others such as Picasso were experimenting with similar
ideas at the time, its brazen statement of counterculture brought a
sharp and unprecedented clarity to the underlying principle: Duchamp’s
“readymades” contended that art, and creativity, can come about from
literally any object, through the pure force of authorial intent. The
more general term for this kind of work is “found art”, both in the
sense that it is art that can be “found” in the environment, but also
that it becomes art because it is “found [to be] art” through discourse.
Duchamp explained that <em>“an ordinary object [could be] elevated to
the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist”</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="learning_2023">[82]</span>.</p>
<p>Duchamp’s urinal may seem far removed from our everyday experience of
creative authorship. Yet as Goldsmith notes <span class="citation"
data-cites="acker2011against">[1]</span>, the vast majority of cultural
transactions on the Internet revolve around readymades: <em>“To be the
originator of something that becomes a broader meme trumps being the
originator of the actual trigger event that is being reproduced. The
“re-” gestures – such as reblogging and retweeting – have become
cultural rites of cachet in and of themselves. If you can filter through
the mass of information and pass it on as an arbiter to others, you gain
an enormous amount of cultural capital”</em>. In the era of social
media, the curatorial intent behind re-sharing has come to carry its own
cultural cachet of creativity. Such is the role of the “trail blazer” in
Bush’s world of the Memex <span class="citation"
data-cites="bush1945we">[28]</span>, <em>“who find delight in the task
of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common
record”</em>.</p>
<p>Authorial intent can do more than directly imbue an object with the
property of being “creative”. Often, the author’s context and stated
intent are used to disambiguate vocabulary and references, and to
identify and interpret metaphors. Consider the following lines from Maya
Angelou’s <em>Caged Bird</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="angelou1983caged">[5]</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The free bird thinks of another breeze<br />
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br />
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br />
and he names the sky his own.<br />
<br />
But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams<br />
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br />
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br />
so he opens his throat to sing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had Angelou been a well-known animal rights activist, the common
interpretation of this poem would have been as an agitation against
keeping birds in cages. But she was, of course, a civil rights activist,
and with this knowledge one is justified in the interpretation that the
birds are people, and the cage is racism. Works of art and literature
generally do not include biographies of the authors and descriptions of
their intent within the body of the work. It is context from outside the
content of the work which is nevertheless essential for understanding
the information content of the work, and evaluating it as creative or
otherwise. Borges’ delightful short story <em>Pierre Menard, Author of
the Quixote</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="borges1962ficciones">[22]</span> takes this idea to a
logical extreme, in which the author Menard has written (though not
copied) text identical to chapters from Cervantes’ <em>Don Quixote</em>,
but which the narrator views as far superior due to differences in
historical circumstance between Menard and Cervantes: <em>“The Cervantes
text and the Menard text are verbally identical, but the second is
almost infinitely richer. [...] It is a revelation to compare the Don
Quixote of Pierre Menard with that of Miguel de Cervantes”</em>.</p>
<p>As Foucault notes, access to as-yet unpublished notes or new
information about an author, or even a return to familiar texts, can
affect and revise our interpretation of works and their meaning <span
class="citation" data-cites="foucault2017author">[51]</span>. A notable
example of this is the publication in the late 1920s and early 1930s of
Marx’s <em>Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</em>, which
nearly a century after their writing finally enabled a clearer
interpretation of key concepts in Marxian philosophy, such as
“alienation”, which was poorly understood in Marx’s own lifetime <span
class="citation" data-cites="musto2010revisiting">[103]</span>.</p>
<p>Creative objects exist not as individual quanta of information, but
in a reactive and shifting network. In this view, the meaning of an
AI-generated text and therefore its status as creative, is not static,
but may change depending on other texts that the AI generates, and other
discourse that we draw upon as interpretive resources that support the
text.</p>
<p>At this point, one might ask: to what extent is authorial intent
relevant to AI? We do not want to attribute undue personhood or agency
to the AI system itself (Dennett’s intentional stance). Perhaps it is
easier to argue that the human-AI-data complex responsible for a
particular AI output is the author. However, it is also possible to
argue that AI itself can be considered an author, without granting it
personhood or agency.</p>
<p>Foucault considers the question of what an author entity, or “author
function” actually is <span class="citation"
data-cites="foucault2017author">[51]</span>, especially when used as an
interpretive resource to help establish the meaning of a text:
<em>“Modern criticism, in its desire to ‘recover’ the author from a work
[... is] reminiscent of Christian exegesis [... in determining the
authors of a text when it is unclear who wrote it.] According to Saint
Jerome, there are four criteria: the texts that must be eliminated from
the list of works attributed to a single author are those inferior to
the others (thus, the author is defined as a standard level of quality);
those whose ideas conflict with the doctrine expressed in the others
(here the author is defined as a certain field of conceptual or
theoretical coherence); those written in a different style and
containing words and phrases not ordinarily found in the other works
(the author is seen as a stylistic uniformity); and those referring to
events or historical figures subsequent to the death of the author (the
author is thus a definite historical figure in which a series of events
converge)”</em>.</p>
<p>These criteria: a level of quality, conceptual coherence, stylistic
uniformity, and historicity, can be applied to AI to give it an author
function without also granting it agency or personhood. These ways of
producing an author entity may seem imprecise in our modern world, where
it is far easier to definitively establish the author of a text, and
often possible to ask them directly: “did you write this?” and “what did
you mean by this?” Even with these powers, unavailable to Saint Jerome,
we still conceive of authors in Jeromian terms. For instance,
Wittgenstein’s later work contrasts so heavily with his earlier work
that references often qualify him as “early Wittgenstein” or “late
Wittgenstein”, as though they were two separate people (this is also
sometimes done with Marx to distinguish “young Marx” <span
class="citation" data-cites="musto2015young">[104]</span>, presumably
from “old Marx” but the latter is rarely used). Artists’ lives are
commonly periodised (e.g., Picasso’s “blue period”). This schizophrenic
segmentation shows that we are willing to detach a singular person from
the authorial entity or entities they gave rise to over the course of
their life. Legal conceptions of authorship have similarly long been
divorced of personhood, where “investments of capital and administrative
organisation” can constitute authorship <span class="citation"
data-cites="bently1994copyright">[13]</span>.</p>
<p>In January 2023, several academic publishers, such as the Science
family of journals, updated their editorial policies to ban the naming
of ChatGPT as author on papers, some going as far as to prohibit the use
of AI technologies to generate content for papers altogether (though it
is unclear how this can be enforced) <span class="citation"
data-cites="doi:10.1126/science.adg7879">[134]</span>. Ostensibly, the
practice of naming ChatGPT as an author stems from a desire to attribute
its “participation” in the creative process. Yet this was not a safe or
acceptable solution. A reason cited by publishers for this ban is that
authors are accountable for the content in their papers, and ChatGPT is
not an entity that can be held accountable to anything by anyone.
Publishers also interpreted the use of ChatGPT output in a paper, as the
(human) co-authors plagiarising text from ChatGPT, even it when named as
an author <span class="citation"
data-cites="doi:10.1126/science.adg7879">[134]</span>. Again, we witness
a community response to the challenge of selecting one imperfect notion
of authorship (and therefore creativity, or plagiarism) among a number
of imperfect notions. The inclusion of ChatGPT as an author in this
scenario was culturally unacceptable because of one particular
interpretation of the author function.</p>
<p>A final example of how discourse, intent, and context determine the
creative content of an object comes from our very own discipline of
interaction design. In research-through-design, the aim is to produce
knowledge by designing artefacts. The objects in isolation carry no
knowledge content; the objects are simply design, not
research-through-design. In research-through-design, the creative
knowledge content of an artefact (which is judged by the community
standards of peer review) depends on the rigour of the methods applied,
and the associated discourse which elaborates the knowledge content and
situates it with respect to related work <span class="citation"
data-cites="gaver2012should zimmerman2007research">[56, 148]</span>.</p>
<p>With the view that creativity comes from authorial intent and
discourse, when considering whether a particular episode of AI-assisted
production is creative or not, we must not look only at the output
itself. The output may be even be “found” or “readymade” from the
training data, without attribution. A discursive assessment of
creativity will consider, in what context is this output being used or
presented? What is the authorial intent? What discourse is it
facilitating? Who or what are we considering to be the author
entity?</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3" id="sec:interpretation"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Interpretation as
creativity</h3>
<p>The previous discussion of meaning as constructed depending on
context raises the question of who is doing the construction. This leads
us to another family of ideas relating to the role of the observer
(viewer, reader, consumer) of an object in determining its creative
content. McLuhan puts it bluntly <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcluhan1994understanding">[94]</span>: <em>“A work of art
has no existence or function apart from its effects on human
observers.”</em></p>
<p>The emphasis on the reader or viewer arose in part as a reaction to
the status quo of literary and art criticism in the mid-20<sup>th</sup>
century, which focused so heavily on authorial intent and context,
bordering on deification of the author. Barthes in his seminal <em>Death
of the Author</em> highlights the shortcomings of this view and offers a
solution <span class="citation"
data-cites="barthes2016death">[9]</span>: <em>“it is language which
speaks, not the author [...] to give a text an Author is to impose a
limit [...] In the multiplicity of writing, everything is to be
disentangled [...] writing ceaselessly posits meaning [...] but there is
one place where this multiplicity is focused and that place is the
reader”</em>.</p>
<p>Abstract expressionism aimed to elevate the process of production
over the outcome. This also highlighted the artist’s embodied presence
in the work: the splashes of paint on a canvas by Pollock echo the swing
of his arms. This elevated the artist above the viewer, which was an
undesirable outcome for the counter-movement known as Minimalism.
Artists such as Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland (and cognates in music:
Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Brian Eno, etc.) sought to distance and even
remove the hand of the author, using repetitive patterns, and a
minimality of means, meaning, and structure, thus hoping to increase the
involvement of the recipient in the work of art <span class="citation"
data-cites="vaneenoo2011minimalism">[135]</span>. According to Bernard
<span class="citation" data-cites="bernard1993minimalist">[14]</span>:
<em>“minimal art is aimed in part at achieving an impersonal quality,
avoiding the depiction of personality that most minimalist artists felt
had become entirely too explicit [...] to remove the accompanying
interposition of artist’s personality between artwork and
viewer”</em>.</p>
<p>In literature the counter-movement against authorial intent became
known as “reader-response criticism” <span class="citation"
data-cites="iser1984reader">[72]</span>. Among the most vehement
proponents were the American New Critics, who rejected the notion of
authorial intent outright. The entire meaning of a text was in the text
itself, and information from outside the text including and especially
the author’s intent, was irrelevant in interpretation. Having finished
writing a text, the author is equivalent to any other reader, and has no
special claim to understanding the work due to being its author. To
value the author’s intent above the interpretation of other readers was
to commit the <em>intentional fallacy</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="wimsatt1946intentional">[143]</span>, a literary
foreshadowing of Dennett’s intentional stance. The position of the New
Critics is perhaps too extreme to defend, and counterexamples, such as
the excerpt from Angelou in the previous section, clearly exhibit the
need for extrinsic context for interpretation <span class="citation"
data-cites="nuttall1968did">[107]</span>. The trap of assuming that the
substantive content of a work can be derived purely from its form is the
very same one we fall into when evaluating the creativity of AI based on
its output. The point of reader-response criticism, however, is that
even when extrinsic information is discounted, the same form can reveal
different contents, different responses, depending on the reader’s
individual interpretation. The view of creativity as interpretation
tells us that in order to evaluate whether something produced by AI is
creative or not, we must ask: according to which interpretation of the
output?</p>
<p>Yet elevating the reader and the importance of interpretation also
has its own critics. According to critics of reader-response, allowing
for “interpretation” to create content from form is a license to
transform any work into anything else. At the extreme, interpretation
renders meaningless the formal differences between texts; any text can
be interpreted as having the meaning of any other text. Thus Sontag
protests <span class="citation"
data-cites="sontag1994against">[132]</span>: <em>“Interpretation [...]
presupposes a discrepancy between the clear meaning of the text and the
demands of (later) readers [...] The interpreter, without actually
erasing or rewriting the text, is altering it [...] interpretation
excavates, and as it excavates, destroys; it digs ‘behind’ the text, to
find a sub-text which is the true one. [...] interpretation is the
revenge of the intellect upon art”</em>. While expressed so poetically,
the universalism of this position is as difficult to defend as that of
the New Critics; Sontag appears not to acknowledge the role her own
formidable and vengeful intellect plays in creating the “clear meaning
of the text”.</p>
<p>Many of these contradictory viewpoints are visible in the
author-reader relations of J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter
series of fiction novels. The Harry Potter community looked to Rowling’s
authorial intent as an interpretive resource. When Rowling “revealed”
that Albus Dumbledore, a main character, was gay (despite there being no
evidence of this in the text), the community was eager to re-interpret
the books with this lens <span class="citation"
data-cites="irwin2015authorial">[71]</span>. This declaration of
authorial intent signalled Rowling as an ally of the LGBTQ+ community.
However, when Rowling’s play <em>The Cursed Child</em> began
performances, the community accused Rowling of “queerbaiting” <span
class="citation" data-cites="masad_2016">[93]</span>, which is to use
the suggestion of homoromantic interest to appeal to the LGBTQ+
audience, while being non-committal enough to avoid being alienating to
heteronormative society. For many in the LGBTQ+ community, the value of
Rowling’s authorial intent has been further undermined by her criticism
of trans individuals, and her claims that trans-positive discourse is
harmful to children, that trans activism is misogynist, and that trans
women are a threat to “biological” women <span class="citation"
data-cites="duggan2022transformative">[47]</span>. In response, queer
communities are reclaiming the texts from Rowling’s authorial intent,
and re-queering them through fan fiction and community engagement.</p>
<p>The tumultuous relationship between Rowling and her community of
readers shows that while literary critics are free to spill as much ink
as they like for or against the intentional fallacy, for or against
interpretation, the most forceful and consequential arbiter of the
content of a work is the community that consumes it. Examples such as
Rowling’s echo in miniature the Protestant Reformation, perhaps the
greatest of all community movements to reclaim interpretation from
author-ity. The force of the community will also significantly shape the
reception of artwork, literature, and any knowledge artefact produced
with AI.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.4" id="sec:reuse"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Reuse as creativity</h3>
<p>Recall the common position taken when assessing AI creativity:
plagiarism is reuse without attribution. Reuse is permitted in creative
works, but only with attribution: the taint of plagiarism negates any
claim to creativity. Creativity and plagiarism are mutually exclusive.
Thus one can only be creative either by avoiding reuse altogether, or by
attributing every source on which one draws, which makes clear the
<em>novel</em> creative component of a particular work. But are these
tenets universally applicable?</p>
<p>This section describes an alternative conception of creativity which
holds that there is no such thing as creativity without reuse, and that
exhaustive attribution is literally impossible. Moreover, norms around
what constitutes “proper” attribution are not universal. In several
historical circumstances, proper attribution has been deliberately
avoided; there are practical and ethical reasons for “improper”
attribution.</p>
<p>In literature the reuse inherent in every work is articulated by
Barthes <span class="citation" data-cites="barthes2016death">[9]</span>:
<em>“a text is [...] a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of
writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue
of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture. [...] the
writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never
original. His only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with
the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them.”</em></p>
<p>Despite all text being a “tissue of quotations”, we can still
recognise new works as creative and novel. In <em>The Anxiety of
Influence</em>, Bloom examines the early 19<sup>th</sup> century
Romantics to develop a theory for how novelty can emerge from reuse
<span class="citation" data-cites="bloom1997anxiety">[17]</span>. Bloom
posits that all poets suffer from the anxiety of being derivative of
precursor poets. However, Bloom observes that “strong” poets can respond
in one of six ways to precursor poets, to create an original poetic
vision despite the anxiety of influence. For example, a poet can offer a
completion, or antithesis, to an idea “started” by a precursor poet.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the kind of reuse Barthes and Bloom talk
about is fundamentally unattributable. It is a probabilistic,
subconscious mixing of “innumerable centres of culture”, of all
sense-impressions and memories. If we take the Barthes/Bloom view of all
work as fundamentally reuse, all authorship as fundamentally under
influence, then pointing out the reuse nature of AI is redundant. The
important question is how the AI output has responded to the training
data it reuses, and whether it can be said to have constructed an
original vision, e.g. by Bloom’s criteria or by some other.</p>
<p>Not only do writers inexorably reuse ideas from other writers, but
they also rely on the ideas of readers to help construct meaning. This
is different from the earlier point about the role of reader
interpretation. The theory of “cognitive capitalism” <span
class="citation" data-cites="moulier2011cognitive">[100]</span> holds
that any work depends on the “general intellect”, a term mentioned in
passing by Marx, which cognitive capitalists have expanded to mean the
vast sets of knowledge and experience that are shared by members of a
culture, and which artists draw upon. A comedian telling a “knock-knock”
joke about waiting in line at a supermarket relies on the general
intellect of a culture that is familiar with the form of such a joke,
and also with supermarkets. Similarly, any text, artwork, or knowledge
artefact draws on a basis of innumerable cultural, linguistic, and
semantic connections – most of which is not, cannot be, and need not be,
attributed. Barthes extends this reliance on general intellect to the
very words of the author’s vocabulary <span class="citation"
data-cites="barthes2016death">[9]</span>: <em>“[Should the author] wish
to express himself, he ought at least to know that the inner ‘thing’ he
thinks to ‘translate’ is itself only a ready-formed dictionary, its
words only explainable through other words, and so on
indefinitely”</em>. In text, words are re-used resources, given meaning
only by the network of associations in the general intellect of the
reader (some semioticians may disagree, but a discussion of this is out
of scope).</p>
<p>Words are fundamentally unattributable, as are concepts such as the
knock-knock joke or the supermarket, nor do we wish to attribute them.
If every work stands on a towering edifice of reused associations, we
select only a miniscule fraction of these as worthy of attribution,
depending on the context; this cultural delimitation of attribution
reflects societal judgements of where “value” comes from in a work.
These societal judgements are not moral universals, but are continually
negotiated and renegotiated by different actors in the “value chain” of
a knowledge work, to further private interests.</p>
<p>Numerous art forms are based on reuse. Collage, decoupage, and
montage have been employed since the high middle ages. The art form of
erasures, as in Tom Phillips’ Humument <span class="citation"
data-cites="phillips1987humument">[113]</span>, creates new texts by
selectively erasing old ones. Reuse, when apparent, invites an automatic
comparison between the original work and its reused form: this effect is
exploited by subvertising, détournement, and “culture jamming” to make
artistic or political statements by corrupting and re-imagining public
advertising and signage <span class="citation"
data-cites="debord1956methods">[42]</span>. The attributional culture
around each of these art forms does not require the authors of the
source scraps of material to be attributed. No one demands attribution
for the authors and photographers whose work appears in the magazine and
newspaper clippings which constitute the Dadaist collage of Hannah Höch,
or the pop art photomontage of Richard Hamilton. These exemplify a
distinct contextual, community-driven interpretation of creativity,
plagiarism, and fair attributive norms.</p>
<p>Jazz improvisation includes the practice of “quotation”: the
inclusion of small, well-known melodic/harmonic motifs by other
composers <span class="citation"
data-cites="murphy1990jazz">[102]</span>. It is an encouraged and
celebrated aspect of the art form, and functions as a way for the
performer to demonstrate their knowledge of jazz repertoire, for them to
converse and engage with other composers, and as a sign of respect and
attribution to the quoted composers. Similarly, sampling practices in
hip-hop <span class="citation"
data-cites="schloss2014making">[122]</span>, and the practices of
lyrical reference in rap music serve to create a dialogue between
artists and also to acknowledge mutual creative influences. Unlike the
world of textual attributions, which operates through names and
bibliometric document identifiers, the attributional natures of
quotation, sampling, and lyrical reference rely on the listener’s
knowledge and attitude. When a knowledgeable listener hears a quotation
or a sample, it is heard not as an unattributed plagiarist reuse, but as
a self-contained unit of conversation, reuse, and attribution. It is
simultaneously a hat-tip to the prior composers and a wink at the
audience. As the rapper Pusha T puts it so succinctly: <em>“If you know,
you know”</em>. This merging of citation and use, of quoting and
attribution, was intolerable to Foucault, who nonetheless observed, and
attempted to justify, that such merging was inevitable even in the
highly formal attributional norms of scientific writing <span
class="citation" data-cites="hess2006foucault">[67]</span>. Jazz
quoting, hip-hop sampling, and rap references exemplify yet another
distinct contextual, community-driven interpretation of how reuse
relates to creativity, plagiarism, and fair attributive norms.
Unfortunately, as we will see later, these norms come into violent
conflict with the blunt instruments of copyright law.</p>
<p>Brueghel the Younger, a skilled painter but widely considered to be
relatively unoriginal in comparison to his father, made a career out of
copying and replicating his father’s designs <span class="citation"
data-cites="currie2012pieter">[38]</span>. Yet he was not a plagiarist:
he did not present his own works as those of his father, he often subtly
adapted the design to suit his customer’s tastes, and he was extremely
commercially successful and well-respected in his day <span
class="citation" data-cites="kopenkina_2022">[80]</span>. Modern critics
who have labelled him a knockoff or copycat are therefore
inappropriately applying modern ideals around creativity and
originality, modern notions of the artistic value chain alien to the
ateliers of 16<sup>th</sup> century Flemish painters, as though they are
spatiotemporal universals.</p>
<p>In several historical circumstances, attribution has been
deliberately avoided. Victorian women often published under masculine
pen-names (e.g., Mary Anne Evans took the pen name George Eliot; the
Brontë sisters and Louisa May Alcott also took masculine names) to
increase the commercial acceptability of their work, and to avoid
negative societal stereotypes attached to women writers. J.K. Rowling
published a detective series under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, to
spare the series from the inevitable and unfair comparison to Harry
Potter. Other writers published controversial or contentious ideas under
pen names to avoid persecution or censorship (e.g., Voltaire – already a
pen name – was known to deny the authorship of his controversial
writings, preferring to attribute them to imaginary or sometimes real
people). Eric Blair took the name George Orwell when publishing his
memoir of growing up in poverty, to protect his family from
embarrassment. Some men take on women’s names when writing for an
audience comprised of primarily women, in some cases multiple authors
collaborate under a single pen name <span class="citation"
data-cites="smith2006inkwell">[130]</span>. The point is that there are
many legitimate reasons for subverting “proper” attribution which have
no bearing on deemed creativity.</p>
<p>Another case where the assumed relationship between creativity,
attribution, and plagiarism is challenged is in the forgery. The
18<sup>th</sup> century poet Thomas Chatterton forged numerous poems in
a medieval style, attributed to a 15<sup>th</sup> century priest, which
significantly influenced English, French, and German literature. Similar
episodes of forgery include James MacPherson’s “Ossian” and Edward
Williams’ “Iolo Morganwg” <span class="citation"
data-cites="constantine2019possibilists">[36]</span>. There are many
examples in the world of visual art, as well. Initially, these forgeries
are considered creative on account of their content and their presumed
authorship. Later, when the forgery is exposed, the creativity
associated with these works does not disappear but is transformed. Today
we celebrate the ingenuity of Chatterton and Williams, and appreciate
the creative effort and talent required to masterfully reproduce the
form of another artist, with the same conflicted fascination that we
watch the protagonist in Frank Abagnale Jr.’s <em>Catch Me If You
Can</em>. It is not without reason that they are called
con-<em>artists</em>.</p>
<p>If we take the view that creativity is fundamentally reuse, we must
recognise that every sentence we write, artwork we create, etc. is not
only generated by the superposition of influences from innumerable prior
works, but is also given meaning in the world only by reference to other
works. We live in an era of unprecedented media availability and
saturation, which McLuhan dubbed the “electric implosion” <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcluhan1994understanding">[94]</span>.
Filmmaker Kirby Ferguson’s documentary series <em>Everything is a
Remix</em> recovers Barthes and Bloom in the digital age <span
class="citation" data-cites="ferguson_2022">[50]</span>. It is easier
than ever to find influences in our media environment, and more
difficult than ever to avoid them. The anxiety induced in the Romantics
by the passive, poetic influencer pales in comparison to the anxiety
induced in modern society by the active, propagandistic social media
influencer. <em>“You Are Not a Parrot”</em>, declares <em>New York</em>
magazine, confidently summarising the view of linguist Emily Bender
<span class="citation" data-cites="weil_2023">[141]</span>, who strongly
resists any analogies between human language production and the
“stochastic parrot” nature of large language models. Perhaps this view
is defensible from a linguistic perspective, but it has been repeatedly
repudiated from a literary perspective, a discipline which is decidedly
closer to the questions of creativity and plagiarism.</p>
<p>It is impossible to determine every influence on our work and
attribute them, so we settle on a culturally constructed compromise on
the limits to what must be attributed. The result is that the
overwhelming majority of influences that feed and enable any creative
work remain unattributed. Thus the re-use and non-attributive natures of
AI are not universal grounds to deny creativity, or accuse it of
plagiarism. We must first ask: are we applying the standards of
attribution appropriate to the context? What types of reuse are we
(in)visibilising? Do the authors of sources desire attribution?</p>
<h3 data-number="2.5" id="sec:randomness"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Randomness as creativity</h3>
<p>Randomness, or stochasticity, is an essential element of both the
training and generation phases of AI. Critics who argue against the
attribution of creativity to AI nonetheless note that randomness can be
effectively used as a resource for producing creative work, as in Cage’s
“aleatoric compositions” <span class="citation"
data-cites="leong2006randomness">[86]</span> and Eno’s “oblique
strategies” <span class="citation"
data-cites="eno1975oblique">[49]</span>. In these practices, creativity
comes not from the random process itself, but from the way in which the
artist uses it to produce the resultant work. Blackwell writes <span
class="citation" data-cites="blackwell2022coding">[15]</span>:
<em>“Tarot readings, gambling, and other entertaining performances, just
like the compositions of John Cage, use random information as a starting
point for human creativity. But [...] random information is not
communicating anything [...] We can enjoy the performance of a Tarot
reader, but the idea that random events have meaning in themselves is
nonsense. [...] the same is true of the random processes that cause us
to attribute ‘creativity’ to AI systems.”</em></p>
<p>Tarot, gambling, aleatoric composition, and oblique strategies are
all practices which draw explicitly on randomness as a resource for
creativity. Yet there are also many practices which, while they can be
viewed as random, are interpreted by practitioners as channelling a
different creative entity: the subconscious mind, the spirits of
ancestors, or religious beings.</p>
<p>The surrealist practice of “automatic writing”, drawing upon the
theories of Freud, aimed to produce writing without the intervention of
the conscious mind <span class="citation"
data-cites="muhl1930automatic">[101]</span>. Practitioners of automatic
writing included W. B. Yeats and Arthur Conan Doyle. Automatic writers
either held a traditional writing instrument such as a pen, and
attempted to suppress their conscious processes while writing, or used a
specially prepared board such as a planchette. Later interpretations of
automatic writing aimed to channel not just the writer’s subconscious,
but to allow external spirits to guide the writer. This spiritual
interpretation borrowed from practices in other cultures, such as
Chinese Fuji spirit writing <span class="citation"
data-cites="groot1964religious">[63]</span> for channelling various
deities (first recorded in the 5<sup>th</sup> century), medieval
Christian glossolalia or “speaking in tongues” for channelling the holy
spirit <span class="citation"
data-cites="goodman2008speaking">[59]</span>, and American spiritualist
talking boards (which evolved into the well-known parlour game of Ouija
boards) for channelling the spirits of ancestors <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcrobbie_2013">[95]</span>. In each of these cases, the
exercise is not viewed as a human performance seeded by the random
process, the random process is <em>itself</em> the performance, given
agency through concepts such as the subconscious or spirits.</p>
<p>There might be a tendency for readers operating within contemporary
Western ways of knowing to respond to examples such as spirit writing
and Ouija boards by denying their cultural interpretation of being
“extrinsic” to the human actors: “sure, spirit writers <em>claim</em>
they are not creating a performance, but in <em>reality</em>, humans are
still the true source of creativity, not any spirits.” This is
orientalist hubris. If we accept that definitions of creativity are
ultimately contextual and community-driven, we must also be open to
accepting community conceptions of the source(s) of creativity. The
stochastic nature of AI is not universal grounds to deny its potential
to be viewed by a practitioner community as a source of creativity.</p>
<h2 data-number="3" id="sec:form_content"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> The form-content distinction</h2>
<p>In previous sections, we have implicitly encountered the idea that
there is a difference between form and content, or form and meaning.
When we considered how authorial intent and interpretation can both
affect meaning, it seems clear that the physical configuration of words
on a page, or pixels on a screen, is only part of what determines the
creative contribution (or plagiaristic nature) of a work. Here there are
more community-produced norms regarding to what extent “form” determines
content, and more fundamentally, what the “unique form” of a work even
is.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.1" id="what-is-form"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> What is form?</h3>
<p>What do we consider to be the “unique form” of a text? Is it a
certain configuration of letters or bits? Is each different occurrence
of the text, whether on screen as an array of coloured pixels, or in ink
printed on paper, a different form? In general we would not consider two
printed copies of the same text to be different forms, despite the
innumerable minute physical differences between the copies, such as
being printed on different paper, with slightly different ink, etc.
These differences are not relevant to our typical determination of
textual form, which generally relies on an abstract notion of an
arrangement of characters. A notion of “unique form” centres around
relevant and irrelevant differences. Unique forms are separated from
each other only by relevant differences. Forms separated only by
irrelevant differences have the same unique form.</p>
<p>But there is no notion of form universal to all texts. Change the
line breaks in a news article and it remains the same. Do the same to a
poem and the meaning changes. Change the typeface of a school homework
essay and it remains the same. Do the same to a magazine advertisement
and it is transformed. Some genres of literature take this formalist
emphasis to the extreme: “Concrete poetry” celebrates the typographic
form, showing how the arrangement of letterforms can be used as a visual
material, quite distinct from the language semantics that arise when
arranged into known words. As Draper puts it <span class="citation"
data-cites="draper1971concrete">[45]</span>, <em>“the shaping of
patterns takes preference over communication”</em>. Similarly, “sound
poetry” focuses on the architectural configuration of phonetic speech
sounds, rather than the formation of words <span class="citation"
data-cites="perloff2009sound">[112]</span>. Concrete and sound poetry
can be viewed as prioritising “form over content”, yet they can also be
viewed as showing how a different kind of content can be created out of
form. This fascination for form-content subversion is not limited to
obscure corners of early 20<sup>th</sup> century poetry; to show its
enduring popularity one need only note the viral success of the Netflix
series <em>Is It Cake?</em></p>
<p>In philosophy the issue of “type-token” distinction is related <span
class="citation" data-cites="sep-types-tokens">[142]</span>. The problem
is that literary and art critics (or critics of AI output) often talk
about a work as an abstract form, or a type. Yet “types” do not
physically exist, only tokens – manifestations that we can perceive.
Philosophical scholars have variously characterised types as sets,
kinds, or laws, and have argued for both their existence and
non-existence. The question for AI is this: each output “token” (in the
philosophical sense, not the natural language processing sense), i.e.,
each time an output is displayed, is generally not considered to be a
novel creative act. If an AI’s output text is copied and pasted form one
application to another, or printed, these various instances are
generally all considered to be tokens of the same original “type”, an
attitude we inherit naturally from 21<sup>st</sup> century knowledge
work norms. In doing so we are implicitly choosing some notion of “form”
which may not be universally shared by all human interpreters or
appropriate for all contexts. This is relevant when the work is being
scrutinised for creativity or plagiarism. If we choose a notion of form
that is sensitive to line breaks, to typeface, to materiality, etc.,
then these must be carried over from the original token into any
subsequently distributed copies, and we must be aware of how the
processes of copying and distribution might introduce relevant formal
(potentially creative) differences.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.2" id="how-much-does-form-determine-content"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> How much does form determine
content?</h3>
<p>Once a community has agreed suitable norms around what constitutes
form, there is the question of to what extent this form determines
content. In art and literary criticism (except with procedural and
conceptual art), despite the enormous influence of authorial intent and
interpretation, form is generally considered paramount to content.
Change a line of a poem by Wordsworth, or a soliloquy by Shakespeare,
and the entire content is transformed. Retelling the story of Romeo and
Juliet in my own words is to not convey Shakespeare at all, and would
not be considered plagiarism in the strictest sense. A rose by another
name is another thing. A restatement is a reinvention.</p>
<p>Contrast that to the way in which form is understood to relate to
content in academic writing. In this paper, like in all academic
writing, an idea is presented that is understood to be quite distinct
from the words used to convey it. This allows the community to defend
against a different kind of plagiarism during peer review: <em>“This
idea was already published by X et al”</em>. A restatement is not a
reinvention.</p>
<p>Art and literature harbour both extremes of form-content
determination. On one extreme, where content is an idea quite abstracted
from form, is popular media. The popular conception of originality tends
to skew in preference to evaluating an abstract notion of content over a
precise form. Critical television viewers, readers, and moviegoers tend
to reject storylines and tropes that are borrowed wholesale from other
popular works with which they are familiar, recognising that the
fundamental “idea” underneath is what counts, not the way in which it is
expressed. On the other extreme, where content is entirely determined by
a precise form, are writers like Walter Benjamin. In <em>The
Translator’s Task</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="benjamin2021translator">[12]</span>, Benjamin explains that
a translation – whose entire aim is ostensibly to achieve a shift in
form without a shift in content – is fundamentally impossible:
<em>“translation is merely a preliminary way of coming to terms with the
foreignness of languages to each other. A dissolution of this
foreignness [...] remains out of human reach [...] the relation between
content and language in the original is entirely different from that in
the translation [... which] remains inappropriate, violent, and alien
with respect to its content [...] from outside it, facing it, and
without entering it, the translation calls to the original within, at
that one point where the echo in its own language can produce a
reverberation of the foreign language’s work”</em>.</p>
<p>The line between form and content is precisely the one skirted by
knockoff brands, which evade legal action through clever modifications
of the legally formalised elements of brand identity, which differ
sufficiently from the original to render them nonequivalent according to
formal legal comparisons. On the other hand, the similarities they
retain allow them to still benefit from consumers’ mental association
with the original brand.</p>
<p>Political activism has long exploited the ability to separate content
from politically-controlled form. In 2022, Chinese lockdown protesters
were warned by the police not to ask for an end to lockdowns. The crowd
responded <span class="citation" data-cites="wang_2022">[139]</span> by
sarcastically chanting <em>“Continue lockdowns! [...] I want to do Covid
tests!”</em> Sarcasm reverses the assumed content of form. Other
protestors held up blank signs in reference to a Soviet-era joke <span
class="citation" data-cites="adams2005tiny che_chien_2022">[2,
32]</span>; <em>“They know what they want to express, and authorities
know too, so people don’t need to say anything. If you hold a blank
sheet, then everyone knows what you mean”</em>. Context has the power to
synthesise content from an entirely absent form.</p>
<p>The interplay of form, context, intent, and interpretation in
producing content are key not just to political communication, but
innumerable instances of ordinary, everyday communication (as noted in
Grice’s theory of “implicatures” <span class="citation"
data-cites="grice1975logic">[62]</span> and Miller’s theory of
explanations <span class="citation"
data-cites="miller2019explanation">[97]</span>). Indeed the study of
this interplay is an entire sub-field of linguistics <span
class="citation" data-cites="yule1996pragmatics">[147]</span>.</p>
<p>In AI, influence of an idea in the training data may reveal itself as
what appears to be the same idea in content, but not in form. Would this
be considered plagiarism or creativity? A restatement or a reinvention?
The answer depends on which perspectives on the form-content distinction
we apply when evaluating the output. Are we reading it as a poem, or a
scientific paper? Are we applying a popular conception of originality,
or Walter Benjamin’s?</p>
<h3 data-number="3.3" id="labour-mechanisation-and-creativity"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Labour, mechanisation, and
creativity</h3>
<p>Culturally produced form-content distinctions are nuanced and resist
generalisation, but I would cautiously suggest a recurrent pattern:
form-content distinctions (and therefore, distinctions of creativity and
originality) fall along the lines of mechanical reproduction. Where we
see the labour of the human hand, we see a difference in content. If a
work is copied artfully by hand, the human labour involved often grants
it a new “aura” <span class="citation"
data-cites="benjamin1935work">[11]</span>, an originality of its own.
When the medieval scribes copies a manuscript, or the sculptor’s
apprentice copies an original marble by his master, the copies have
intrinsic creative value despite their “formal” equivalence to the
original. But when a text is copied by print, or a sculpture produced
through a 3D printer, we see it as the same work as the original. Today
we are much less likely to consider a hand-copied text to be different
from the original than our medieval ancestors, because our cultural
attitudes to the value chain in text production have been conditioned by
centuries of the mechanisation of print.</p>
<p>The general (though not universal) principle is this: the lower the
marginal human labour of reproduction, the less we distinguish the new
forms as unique types, the more we see them as tokens of the same
general type. Mechanisation turns formerly relevant differences in form,
differences which arise or can be manipulated through the mechanical
process, into irrelevant differences. I believe the same principle is at
play in the Japanese manga example at the start of the paper:
“classical” fan art is culturally acceptable because copying involves
labour. AI-generated fan art is not, because the form of copying it
enables is not laborious in the same way. Goldsmith notes that the huge
quantitative increase in the speed of copying enabled by computers
resulted in the qualitative departure of conceptual writing from earlier
forms <span class="citation" data-cites="acker2011against">[1]</span>:
<em>“previous forms of borrowing in literature – collage or pastiche,
taking a sentence from here, a sentence from there – were predicated on
the sheer amount of manual labor involved: to retype an entire book is
one thing, and to cut and paste an entire book is another. The ease of
appropriation has raised the bar to a new level”</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the launch of DeviantArt’s DreamUp AI art generation
service upset many artists due to its opt-in default <span
class="citation" data-cites="edwards_2022">[48]</span>. Commentary
around the community reaction rejected the comparison of AI art
generation to collage, feeling that copying the style of an artist was
qualitatively different from collage. Artists’ own conceptions of the
fundamental injustice again centred on the labour requirements of
creating art in this new way: it feels more unjust, more like copying,
when it is made easy in comparison to familiar manual methods. Artist
Kelly McKernan said <span class="citation"
data-cites="woods_ma_2023">[144]</span>: <em>“I almost barely make rent
most months. I will spend, you know, 30 hours on a painting, and I won’t
see any money from that until it sells. [...] There’s more and more
[AI-generated] images that I can see my hand in, but it’s not my work.
I’m kind of feeling violated here. I’m really uncomfortable with
this”</em>. Technological advances have repeatedly thrown into crisis
the ideals of creativity and labour in various artistic communities,
forcing their re-evaluation. In section <a href="#sec:AI_natures"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:AI_natures">5</a> we will
inspect how creativity is being re-evaluated in response to the
challenge of AI, namely, as a shift from material production to critical
integration.</p>
<h2 data-number="4" id="sec:intellectual_property"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> The challenges of intellectual
“property”</h2>
<p>It might seem helpful to look at legal definitions of originality and
creativity, e.g., those referenced in copyright law, to help understand
whether AI can be considered creative. The objective of this section is
to explain why it is <em>not</em> as helpful as it may seem. The
relatively short history of intellectual property (IP) rights is
essentially that of the privatisation of thought as a capitalist
instrument of control. IP law has simultaneously been successful in
furthering private interests, while failing to capture a logically
consistent notion of creativity.</p>
<p>IP consists of legal devices such as copyrights, trademarks, patents,
etc. These are a relatively recent invention. For example, the first
recognisably modern copyright law was the English Statute of Anne of
1710, which granted publishers the exclusive right to print a work for
14 years after its first publication. It was introduced not out of a
desire to empower authors, as it was cleverly pitched at the time, but
rather to further the interests of powerful centralised printing
companies against cheaply made provincial and foreign books. Patterson
observes <span class="citation"
data-cites="patterson1965statute">[111]</span>: <em>“The Statute of Anne
[...] developed by and for publishers, was clearly a publisher’s right,
not an author’s right”</em>. The rights granted implicitly to authors in
this statute were not recognised in English common law until 1774,
sixty-four years later. Similarly, we can expect a new generation of
legal devices invented to manage the IP rights regarding AI output, and
these will not at first protect the entities we subsequently come to
understand as authors, but rather protect the most powerful lobbying
voices.</p>
<p>Just as the privatisation of land forces people to sell labour in
order to eat <span class="citation"
data-cites="sedgewick2021coffeeland">[123]</span>, so the privatisation
of thought functions as an incentive to work in a knowledge economy.
Pasquinelli explains the motivation to pursue stronger intellectual
property regimes bluntly <span class="citation"
data-cites="pasquinelli2009google">[110]</span>: <em>“copyright is one
of the strategic evolutions of rent to expropriate the cultural commons
and reintroduce artificial scarcity. Speculation then is directed toward
intellectual property, forcing artificial costs on cognitive goods that
can paradoxically be reproduced or copied virtually for free.”</em></p>
<h3 data-number="4.1"
id="intellectual-propertys-dual-agenda-and-reliance-on-notation"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Intellectual property’s dual
agenda and reliance on notation</h3>
<p>IP rights are a “negative right”: broadly speaking, the right to
prevent copying of creative ideas. This is a Western idea prioritising
the individual <span class="citation"
data-cites="smith2021decolonizing">[128]</span> based on the theory that
if you protect people’s ideas, they will innovate more, because they
stand to protect their financial gains. On the other hand, progress is
cumulative and ideas build on previous ideas, so one might expect that
society will innovate more if there are fewer IP laws. IP law therefore
aims to strike a balance between these two opposing tendencies. Economic
models and empirical analyses generally come to the intuitive conclusion
that some IP rights can improve innovation, but others can hinder it
<span class="citation"
data-cites="neves2021link gangopadhyay2012does">[55, 105]</span>. IP
rights therefore function more as a governmental lever or dial for
regulating innovation, like the interest rate of a central bank, rather
than as a quest for the legal enshrinement of principled notions of
creativity and ownership. Except that in order to do so, it has
entangled itself in this same quest.</p>
<p>The idea that one owns what one produces through one’s own labour
goes back to Locke <span class="citation"
data-cites="day1966locke">[41]</span>: <em>“Whatsoever, then, he removes
out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed
his labour with [...] and thereby makes it his property”</em>. The
related labour theory of value developed by Smith, Ricardo (and then
Marx) appears somewhat later <span class="citation"
data-cites="day1966locke">[41]</span>. This is complicated by
intellectual property in two ways: first, the “labour” involved in
producing an idea is undefinable and unquantifiable, unlike the labour
of producing material goods. Secondly, labour alone appears insufficient
to qualify for ownership: if I labour to copy a poem written by someone
else, cultural norms around form and content in poetry dictate that the
idea for the poem does not now belong to me. Thus copyright law in
general rejects this “sweat of the brow” doctrine and instead has to
define a notion of originality, i.e., creativity <span class="citation"
data-cites="ginsburg1992no">[58]</span>. This dual agenda of regulating
innovation and defining creativity is the source of many
contradictions.</p>
<p>The main source of problems in the agenda of definition is its
reliance on <em>notation</em>. For an idea to be apprehended by the
legal apparatus, for any judgement to be made regarding the equivalence
or nonequivalence of ideas, they must be notated in a way that
facilitates comparison. Selecting and developing a suitable notation for
the legal codification of ideas is the same as selecting a notion of
unique form, of deciding which differences are relevant and which are
irrelevant. Any particular choice of notation will inevitably highlight
certain aspects of ideas while ignoring others.</p>
<p>In the case of music copyright, courts note that a musical idea must
be written down in staff notation <span class="citation"
data-cites="latham2003newton">[81]</span>. This inherits from the
specific ideals of the European Romantic composers of the
19<sup>th</sup> century, that the composer’s notation expresses the true
“intent” of the music. Yet most genres of music across human cultures
and history, including the vast majority of contemporary music, is not
composed or amenable to notation in this way. This leads to absurdities
such as prohibiting jurors from listening to the music in question <span
class="citation" data-cites="davis20189th">[40]</span>, only looking at
staff notation (which is transcribed by a court-appointed notator, not
the artists themselves) for determining equivalence and nonequivalence
of musical ideas.</p>
<p>In response to the challenges of notation, courts will also employ
“ordinary observer” or “lay listener tests”, which amounts to playing
two pieces of music to the jury to assess if the compositions “feel
substantially” the same, while recognising the primacy of the notational
tests of equivalence. This leads to baffling and contradictory
procedures, such as the following <span class="citation"
data-cites="davis20189th">[40]</span>: <em>“When the case returns to
trial, the jury will continue to not be able to hear [the] original
album recording [...] in order to judge its substantial similarity [...]
The jury will be able to hear the recording in order to weigh access,
but there might be measures in place to make sure the jury doesn’t
listen too closely”</em>. Unsurprisingly, these tests draw criticism
from musicians and legal scholars alike, who note that lay listeners
apply inconsistent and easily biased criteria to judge musical
similarity <span class="citation"
data-cites="lemley2009our palmer2015blurred lund2011empirical">[85, 90,
109]</span>.</p>
<p>Copyright law includes many exceptions and compromises to paper over
questions of form and content, such as the separation of recording,
composition, and performance rights, and the “idea-expression” dichotomy
<span class="citation"
data-cites="newman1999new vezzoso2012copyright">[106, 136]</span>, all
of which are further problematised by new modes of reproduction and
performance enabled by digitalisation. Copyright also includes various
exceptions to cater for the contextual nature of reuse (such as the
“fair use” doctrine which enables reuse for purposes such as education).
These exceptions and contingencies are the result of intellectual
property law attempting to simultaneously act as a governmental lever
for innovation and as an arbiter of originality. The frail nature of
copyright comparisons is also vulnerable to absurd attacks such as
Riehl’s “All the Music” project <span class="citation"
data-cites="riehl_2020">[117]</span>, which has mechanically generated
all possible melodies 10 notes long and released it into the public
domain, to help musicians defend themselves against allegations of
copying.</p>
<p>The dual agenda of defining creativity and regulating innovation
requires arbitrary decisions to be made which can be influenced by
private interests. For example, time limits. Copyrights are not held
indefinitely: in the USA for instance, copyrights expire 70 years after
the death of the author. In what way has the creative nature of the work
changed on the first day of the 70<sup>th</sup> year? The number 70 is
arbitrary, it has been changed several times, and is manipulated by
commercial interests. There is some evidence that the extensions to US
copyright protection periods in 1976 and 1998 were influenced by
lobbying from Disney, whose copyright on Mickey Mouse was about to
expire in each case <span class="citation"
data-cites="moffat2004mutant">[99]</span>. Copyright draws arbitrary
lines in space as well as time: they are unevenly translated between the
jurisdictions of different countries, and they often have different
notational practices for determining equivalence. An idea that is
derivative on one side of the border magically becomes original on the
other side.</p>
<p>Another absurd episode in copyright law is the case of the infamous
“monkey selfie” <span class="citation"
data-cites="rosati2017monkey">[118]</span>. This was a dispute between
British photographer David Slater and the Wikimedia Foundation and
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). The dispute, which
lasted for seven years, centered around whether Slater held the
copyright to a photograph of an Indonesian crested macaque that the
macaque had “taken” of itself while manipulating Slater’s camera. In the
final ruling Slater was granted the copyright not because the courts
determined that he was the source of the creativity and originality in
the image (it was clear that PETA was not actually interested in the
question of creativity but rather sought to raise its own profile
through a sensationalist lawsuit; we will see similar attempts to grab
headlines from companies eager to defend the “rights” of AI), but on the
rather less interesting technicality that non-human actors are not
entitled to copyright protection. But in that case, corporations must
not be entitled to copyright protection either, because they are not
humans. Yet corporations clearly do hold copyrights. This apparent
contradiction (and many others) is resolved due to the legal standing of
corporations as “artificial persons”. This artificial personhood is what
allows corporations to be held accountable for actions, and some call
for AI systems to be given similar personhood to improve its
accountability (though there are criticisms of that approach <span
class="citation" data-cites="bryson2017and">[27]</span>). Depending on
whether a particular AI system has been given legal personhood, it may
or may not be entitled to copyright protection under the current legal
regime, regardless of its creative role.</p>
<p>In the USA a war over electronic book lending is being waged between
librarians and publishers. With physical books, the library purchases
the book and then owns it forever. But they can only lease electronic
books for a certain period of time, after which the lease needs to be
renewed. This is an exorbitant recurring expense which many libraries
cannot afford. The publishers’ argument is essentially that e-book
lending makes it much easier for the public to borrow books, which
reduces sales. Yet this contradicts, or at least undermines the spirit
of the “first sale” doctrine of copyright, which allows owners of
copyrighted works (e.g., libraries) to lend, sell, or share their copies
without requiring permission or paying additional fees <span
class="citation" data-cites="jenkins2014last">[75]</span>. The vastly
reduced costs of replication and distribution throw into crisis these
notions of copyright, exposing its basis as a practical, commercial
mechanism, rather than any universal notion of creativity and
ownership.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.2"
id="societal-harms-of-legal-definitions-of-creativity"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Societal harms of legal
definitions of creativity</h3>
<p>The use of copyright to extract value from the creativity of
minorities and to deprive them of credit, compensation, and control, is
well documented <span class="citation"
data-cites="lester2013blurred">[87]</span>. Conversely, challenges to
the notationally-privileged elite always emerge from marginalised
communities. The practices of DJ-ing and turntabling, from which the
referential practices of hip-hop and rap emerged, were forged in the
devastating fires of the South Bronx in the 1970s <span class="citation"
data-cites="katz2012groove">[78]</span>. Artists with no access to
musical instruments or training made virtue of necessity and turned
their playback machines into musical instruments. They echoed the
emancipatory movements made by the cool, improvisational, quotational
jazz of decades earlier, which drew on black literary and musical
traditions <span class="citation"
data-cites="murphy1990jazz">[102]</span>. When marginalised communities
incorporate AI into their creative processes, we may see similarly
disrespectful and appropriational attitudes from the privileged elite.
The stochastic reuse nature of AI may be held against marginalised
communities in the same way that sampling or jazz quotation struggles to
defend its creativity in notationally-biased courtrooms. We may see
transnational conflicts with xenophobic undertones, as exemplified in
the attitudes of Western pharmaceutical giants seeking to suppress the
rights of Indian pharmaceutical companies to manufacture affordable
medicine <span class="citation"
data-cites="grace2004effect">[60]</span>, or the unfair generalisation
from a small set of bad actors to the branding of the entire Chinese
technology industry as being built upon IP theft <span class="citation"
data-cites="lee2018ai">[84]</span>.</p>
<p>Copyright law is further complicated by the fact that copyright of
not just original but also “derivative works” is granted. This opens up
avenues for rent seeking. Many copyright lawsuits are brought not by
artists but by investment firms who have bought the rights and seek to
extract rent by proving “derivation”, essentially the same business
model as patent trolling. This has deleterious effects on entire
creative industries. The aftermath of the 2015 <em>Blurred Lines</em>
and <em>Stay With Me</em> copyright lawsuits has profoundly affected
music production <span class="citation"
data-cites="sisario_2019">[127]</span>. Many artists report feeling
nervous while composing, and fearful of trespassing into what they have
now been conditioned to see as the territory of previous artists. <em>“I
shouldn’t be thinking about legal precedent when I am trying to write a
chorus”</em>, said songwriter Evan Bogart <span class="citation"
data-cites="sisario_2019">[127]</span>. New pre-emptive citational
practices have emerged, occasionally going as far as to name influences
as co-artists. Beyoncé’s 2022 single <em>Break My Soul</em> credits
Robin S.’s performance of <em>Show Me Love</em>, despite clear and
notationally-defensible differences between the two songs <span
class="citation" data-cites="cantor_2022 harding_2022">[29, 64]</span>.
Additional credits continued to be added and removed over time <span
class="citation" data-cites="juzwiak_2022">[76]</span>. Cautious
over-attribution of this kind, and the consequential payment of
fractional royalties, seems to be anticipating, and hoping to defuse,
the crude approximate comparisons of the lay listener test. Foucault
noted how intellectual property laws in a slightly different way,
exerted a chilling effect on authorship, as when granted a text as his
“property” by copyright law, an author needed also to bear the risks,
including punishment for expressing transgressive views <span
class="citation" data-cites="foucault2017author">[51]</span>: <em>“[The
text’s] status as property is historically secondary to the penal code
controlling its appropriation [... prior to copyright laws] books were
assigned real authors [...] only when the author became subject to
punishment [... but] when a system of ownership and strict copyright
rules were established [... it restored] the danger of writing”</em>.
The takeaway for AI is this: community-driven norms for attribution can
shift in response to the threat of legal action. Attributional practices
can be distorted by perceived threats and thus become detached from
notions of creativity and originality.</p>
<p>As far as musical creativity goes, the effort to establish universal,
fair, and logically consistent criteria for originality, equivalence,
and nonequivalence have largely failed. As the creative content of AI
generated works begins to undergo the same legal scrutiny, we can be
assured that the same jumbled mess of notations and tests will continue
to produce non-answers, and pressurise creative communities to
second-guess their creative workflows and attributional practices.</p>

market-making?</h3>
<p>As noted in the previous section on reuse: in the world of
information, a curatorial voice (Bush’s trail blazer) offers more value
now than ever before. The same has long been true of physical goods.
Shaviro <span class="citation" data-cites="shaviro_2008">[124]</span>
notes that Walmart, the world’s largest employer, <em>“focuses entirely
upon circulation and distribution, rather than upon old-style
manufacturing — showing that the sphere of circulation now (in contrast
to Marx’s own time) plays a major role in the actual extraction of
surplus value”</em>. A popular “get rich quick” scheme is drop shipping
(e.g., <span class="citation"
data-cites="hayes2013ultimate">[65]</span>). To start a drop shipping
business, one sets up a digital storefront through which customers can
order various goods. When an order comes in, the drop shipper purchases
the item “just in time” from another store, and orders it to be shipped
to the customer. This business works by price arbitrage: the drop
shipper simply purchases the good at a lower price, but sells it at a
higher price. The supplier is (usually) a Chinese producer with a
listing on a Chinese-language online retail store such as AliExpress.
The drop shipper’s storefront is designed to be attractive and claim a
certain level of luxury, often set up in English and aimed at European
and North American markets. Unlike a retail distributor, the drop
shipper’s infrastructure and investments are minimal: there are no real
estate costs, no costs for maintaining inventory due to the just in time
approach, and negligible labour and operating costs after deploying the
online store. Entire businesses are built on the premise of labelling
cheap mass market commodities as luxuries, such as the successful Daniel
Wellington watch brand <span class="citation"
data-cites="pulvirent_2015">[115]</span>.</p>
<p>In (loose) economics terms, drop shippers can be interpreted as
providing value because they are market-makers <span class="citation"
data-cites="amihud1980dealership">[3]</span>. They are benefiting from
the failure of the market to directly connect customers to suppliers and
offering an interface. On the flip side, they can be viewed as
exploiting the ignorance of the consumer, who could, with a little
effort, order the product at the lower price themselves, and the
ignorance of the supplier, who could, with a little effort, set up their
own similar storefront and charge the premium price themselves. In a
similar manner, the copyright infringer, e.g., the seller of
unauthorised prints of books, or bootleg CDs, or pirated movies, could
be viewed as solving a market failure to bring a certain original work
to a certain viewer, or could be viewed as exploiting the ignorance of
the viewer and of the original source. In legal terms, they are
completely different scenarios. Drop shipping is legal and seen as
solving market problems. Copyright infringement is illegal and seen to
be exploitative. In terms of helping transport information from source
to end-consumer, they are identical. The difference arises in the
<em>consequences</em> of these activities for the various stakeholders
involved. For instance, drop shipping deprives the source of only part
of their potential revenue; piracy deprives them of all of it. The
consequence for AI is this: large language models and image models can
be viewed as a newly efficient method for connecting the end-user with a
space of information defined (partly) using a training dataset. In some
cases this facilitation of information flow could be viewed as helpful
market-making. In others it could be viewed as exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, this section has discussed the problems
created by the dual agenda of intellectual property rights and its
reliance on notation, and the numerous and unsatisfactory compromises
necessary to make such an agenda work in practice. For AI, the
implication is that relying on legal apparatus to help define creativity
and plagiarism is subject to all the same compromises, and simply
furthers the private interests of powerful actors. As designers of

<h2 data-number="5" id="sec:AI_natures"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Shifting community norms for
creativity in AI-assisted knowledge work</h2>
<p>So far we have considered many different conceptualisations of
creativity, of form and notation, and the challenges of legal
definitions. I have suggested two patterns: first, that community is the
ultimate arbiter of creativity, and second, that community conceptions
of creativity often fall along the lines of mechanical (re)production. A
rapid fall in the cost of mechanical production in some parts of the
creative process causes communities to reconceptualise activities such
as art and writing to identify new sources of human value and new loci
of creativity. This section will briefly outline some emergent patterns
for where these new loci might sit according to practitioner
communities, based on studies of AI use in art and writing.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1" id="sec:critical_integration"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> From production to critical
integration</h3>
<p>AI models mechanise and thereby vastly reduce the cost of the
production of information, such as text or images. With further advances
in AI, the marginal human labour of material production, of physically
writing a text, or creating an image, will approach zero. When it is
mechanised, the process of material production will cease to be viewed
as creative. Instead, what we can observe is a shift in knowledge work
from production to <em>critical integration</em>. The output of AI
systems will need to be <em>integrated</em> into a wider workflow
involving human action. Creative labour is therefore expended in
deciding where in the workflow to use the productive power of AI, how to
program it correctly (e.g., in the current generation of large language
models this is done through “prompt engineering” <span class="citation"
data-cites="liu2022design">[89]</span>), and how to process its output
in order to incorporate it. This integration must be <em>critical</em>,
meaning that creative labour is expended in qualitative and expert human
assessment of the output, e.g., generated text might be checked for
factual accuracy, or generated code might be checked for
correctness.</p>
<p>Some have likened this workflow to a “sandwich” <span
class="citation" data-cites="smith_2022">[129]</span>, where the human
work of prompting and editing surrounds the AI generation process.
Critical integration generalises the sandwich, if you like, to the
entire “double loop” <span class="citation"
data-cites="argyris1977double">[6]</span> of critically reacting to
individual instances of AI use, and readjusting entire knowledge
workflows in response to meta-observations and hypotheses about the
roles AI might play. The concept of critical integration can be
illustrated through three studies, in creative writing, in visual arts,
and in programming.</p>
<p>First, Singh et al. studied how creative writing workflows shift
after the introduction of AI assistance <span class="citation"
data-cites="singh2022hide">[126]</span>. In their study, AI assistance
was available continuously as the authors wrote and took multiple forms:
two different types of textual suggestions, and suggested images and
music retrieved from online databases which were displayed/played
ambiently within the editor. For us, the most important observation they
make in this study is that AI-assisted writing consisted of “integrative
leaps”, defined as <em>“the different kinds of interpretation and
expression involved in incorporating aspects of suggestions into the
developing story”</em>. They identify multiple axes of integration such
as indirect-direct (to what extent is an AI suggestion used as-is,
without modification), and exploratory-confirmatory (to what extent is
an AI being used to continue the current narrative, versus as a tool for
exploring alternative narratives). Participants were willing to
attribute creativity to the AI system (e.g., <em>“It was surprising to
see the intelligence of the AI and the creativeness of the
suggestions”</em>), yet still felt ownership of the final text, because
of the numerous authorial decisions required in the course of critical
integration (e.g., <em>“it helps me find an idea, but I was the one who
developed the story and make the story coherent”</em>).</p>
<p>Second, Ploin et al. studied how AI tools affected the workflows of a
cohort of visual artists <span class="citation"
data-cites="Ploin2022">[114]</span>. They found that artists engaged in
five new activities: studying AI to gain a better technical
understanding, selecting/building/combining models, building datasets,
training models, and curating outputs. Artists made critical and
artistic judgements at every stage of the process. The analysis reveals
a new community norm around creativity emerging, which permits the
creativity of production to be attributed to the system. As one artist
put it: <em>“In the process, the model was entirely more creative than a
human. It created images [...] I can’t create”</em>. Yet the role of
critical integration, particularly integration of artwork into the
human-societal discourse of art, is a newly strengthened creative
responsibility of the artist. The artist continues: <em>“The pictures of
the petals are beautiful [...] but it’s only made more meaningful by
[...] a human creator to contextualize and understand the present
moment, because art is created for people in a specific cultural
moment”</em>. Just as with the Singh et al. study, the AI in these
workflows is viewed as its own intrinsic source of creativity while
<em>simultaneously</em> the artist performs the creative work of
critical integration. As the authors note, <em>“creativity is an easier
target than art”</em>. Some creative work can be fairly attributed to
AI, but more creative work is required to turn it into a knowledge
product. Another artist said: <em>“I believe that these algorithms are
and can be creative. [...] But there is a big distinction between that
and making art, or art that is interesting or valid. That requires a lot
of intentionality”</em>.</p>
<p>Third, Sarkar et al. studied reports from programmers using AI
assistance for writing software code <span class="citation"
data-cites="sarkar2022programmingai">[121]</span>. They too observe how
the creative work of writing code changes with AI assistance. It shifts
away from directly determining what character sequence expresses the
programmer’s intent and then physically typing it out. It moves towards
determining suitable prompts (<em>“breaking down a prompt at the
‘correct’ level of detail is also emerging as an important developer
skill”</em>), identifying appropriate opportunities to use AI assistance
in the workflow (<em>“this requires users to form a mental model of when
[AI] is likely to help them in their workflow. This mental model takes
time and intentionality to build [... programmers are] constantly
evaluating whether the current situation would benefit from [AI]
assistance”</em>) and then critically evaluating and assimilating the
output once generated (<em>“developers need to learn new craft practices
for debugging”</em>).</p>
<p>Besides the studies mentioned above, there have been many other
investigations of how contemporary generative AI supports creative and
knowledge work <span class="citation"
data-cites="mirowski2022co chung2022artist miller2019artist van2021ai yang2022ai dang2022beyond gero2022sparks suh2021ai oppenlaender2022creativity inie2023designing caramiaux2022explorers">[30,
33, 39, 57, 66, 70, 96, 98, 108, 133, 146]</span>. Most of these studies
provide empirical evidence or analytical support for varying degrees of
shift towards critical integration and away from production, and show
this shift to be a general pattern across many different types of
creative and knowledge work.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.2" id="sec:critical_integration_implications"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Implications of critical
integration</h3>
<p>In the wake of the release of ChatGPT, many were concerned about the
impact of AI on education, since writing textual answers and essays
forms so much of the “output” required by students over the course of
their learning careers <span class="citation"
data-cites="rudolph2023chatgpt">[119]</span>. What is the point in
learning to write if AI can do it for you? Some lamented this
development, while others were unruffled, pointing to the effect of
calculators on mental arithmetic. The shift to critical integration
suggests that perhaps editing and proofreading an AI-generated essay
becomes the new way of testing student skill, rather than the material
production of the words of the essay.</p>
<p>In the interim, what might be the implications of the shift to
critical integration for labour process issues, class relations, and the
agenda for HCI research and practice? These are important questions
which are largely out of scope for this paper; the focus of this paper
has been to explain the nature of critical integration and to broaden
the scope of discourse around AI and creativity in knowledge work.
However, it is worth briefly touching upon the most salient issues.
Braverman exposed the tendency of capitalism to destroy craftsmanship
and degrade work through Taylorism <span class="citation"
data-cites="braverman1998labor">[23]</span>, extending a Marxian
analysis to the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Greenbaum suggested that
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research and technologies had
been complicit in this degradation, by enabling the transition from
secure, well-paid “brick and mortar” jobs to low-paid and precarious
jobs that were nevertheless highly skilled and challenging <span
class="citation" data-cites="greenbaum1996back">[61]</span>. As an
antidote, Greenbaum suggests that designers and researchers explicitly
consider the consequences of a design agenda on labour, wages, and
organisational structures, using labour studies as a guide. He further
suggests that they ought to be held accountable for these
consequences.</p>
<p>Just as Greenbaum claims CSCW research has contributed to a Marxian
breakdown of knowledge work and created new class struggles and
consolidation of capitalist power, so too do we need to consider whether
we are enabling these outcomes with generative AI, or at least
incorporate the labour process perspective from the outset. Moreover,
just because the community-produced definitions of creativity might be
shifting due to critical integration, and just because material
production can be automated, it does not follow that everyone within a
community wants it to be automated. The implications for the class
identity of knowledge work in response to AI is too broad to be treated
properly in this paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="karakilic2022humans marks2009stuck">[77, 92]</span>, though
it is of great importance to explore in future work.</p>
<p>However, we are still in a transitional phase, and it is unclear how
the technology will evolve and how society will evolve in response.
There are numerous examples of workflows in the early industrial
revolution that were not fully mechanised and were repeatedly
reconfigured over the course of decades as it became possible to
automate more and more of the workflow (or alter the manufacturing
objective to require less human intervention) <span class="citation"
data-cites="crawford_2018">[37]</span>. McLuhan makes this point about
printing: <em>“Typography was no more an addition to the scribal art
than the motorcar was an addition to the horse. Printing had its
‘horseless carriage’ phase of being misconceived and misapplied during
its first decades, when it was not uncommon for the purchaser of a
printed book to take it to a scribe to have it copied and
illustrated.”</em></p>
<p>It is harder still to anticipate how the fundamental enterprise of
knowledge work will shift in response to the challenge of AI in the
longer term. Perhaps critical integration is merely a stepping stone,
and future iterations of technology will successively erode the need for
human involvement in knowledge workflows in ever-increasing proportion.
In which case conducting knowledge work “by hand” may for most become an
activity for pleasure and recreation, or an issue of class activism.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.3" id="sec:convergence"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Resisting mechanised
convergence through cultural reversal</h3>
<p>In 1983 Bainbridge noted the ironies of a system that automates
“normal” operations while relying on human operators to step in to
handle exceptional situations and mitigate system errors <span
class="citation" data-cites="bainbridge1983ironies">[8]</span>. This is
the situation we find ourselves in today, a complete reversal of the
19<sup>th</sup> century motivations for developing computing machines
(articulated by Babbage and others <span class="citation"
data-cites="snyder2011philosophical">[131]</span>), which was to
overcome human errors. We have returned from “humans make errors, so
computers step in” to “computers make errors, so humans step in.” This
reversal was perhaps inevitable as we charged computers with an
increasingly broader and more complex set of tasks. McLuhan notes many
such examples of reversals that occur as a technology matures or
intensifies <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcluhan1994understanding">[94]</span>.</p>
<p>One tendency of mechanised production is the convergence of
expression to known and fixed forms. The printing press helped to
standardise spelling (though it is debated to what extent <span
class="citation"
data-cites="howard2006early brengelman1980orthoepists">[24, 69]</span>),
much as spell check does today. Mass manufacturing standardised many
previously bespoke commodities, such as clothing. But when this tendency
for convergence is taken to an extreme, it becomes repulsive. A clear
example is the outcry surrounding Huawei’s “Moon Mode” feature, which
purported to use AI to improve the clarity of pictures of the moon taken
using the camera on the Huawei P30 Pro smartphone. However, it emerged
that the feature worked by merging the user’s photograph with previously
captured higher resolution imagery <span class="citation"
data-cites="brown_2019">[25]</span>. On paper, it seems like a good
idea: it is <em>the</em> moon, after all, and it is the same for
everyone. But the feature received severe criticism for failing to note
a basic sentiment that accompanies picture taking: the pride of personal
possession. This is why millions of tourists take terrible, blurry
photographs of the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower each year despite the
fact that high resolution imagery is freely available online. Being
connected to the act of taking the photograph is more important than the
photograph itself, and this connection was severed by Moon Mode. Per the
Rifleman’s Creed: <em>“There are many like it, but this one is
mine”</em>.</p>
<p>The Moon Mode story is only one extreme example of a generally more
subtle tendency of AI to encourage a convergence of forms. Studies find
that writers who rely on predictive writing become more predictable and
less unique <span class="citation"
data-cites="arnold2020predictive">[7]</span>, and their opinions are
influenced by biases in the model <span class="citation"
data-cites="jakesch2023co">[73]</span>. The Moon Mode controversy (and
rising discontent against the increasingly opinionated and forceful
adjustments made by computational photography more generally <span
class="citation" data-cites="chayka_2022">[31]</span>) signals another
cultural reversal. It pushes back against technological convergence of
forms and says “no, I want this to be <em>my</em> picture”. The consumer
movement to shop local and independent, to consume indie music and
cinema, is a countercultural reaction to globalisation and the era of
chain stores, supermarkets, and malls. So too might we see consumer
movements celebrating independent, artisanal, and craft approaches to
knowledge work. This prospect of reversal is one reason to be optimistic
that our AI future is not one of institutionalised plagiarism and
mindless repetition.</p>
<h2 data-number="6" id="sec:conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This position paper began by summarising the dominant view of AI and
creativity: that the output of AI systems, in information theoretic
terms, cannot be considered creative because of its stochastic reuse
nature. We then viewed various alternative conceptions of creativity: as
a process, as authorial intent, as interpretation, as reuse, and as
randomness – none of which is amenable to straightforward analyses of
information or notation. We discussed the multiple equally valid
positions one might adopt on the form-content distinction. We attended
to the challenges of relying on intellectual property law for analysing
the creativity of AI. Two general patterns were suggested: that
creativity is determined contextually by particular communities, and
that sources of creativity in a workflow are often determined by the
extent to which different portions the workflow are facilitated by
mechanical means.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked to contemporary studies of AI-assisted creative
knowledge work to glimpse how the loci of creativity are shifting. It
appears as though the human labour of <em>production</em> is being
replaced by AI, while the opportunities for creative human input have
shifted to <em>critical integration</em>, which is the assessment of AI
output and the set of authorial decisions required to incorporate that
output into a knowledge workflow. The way in which AI changes our
relationship to the production of knowledge work can be seen as
analogous to how the industrial revolution changed our relationship to
material production. In response we reconfigured our lives and social
practices around the new machine-made artefacts, and there was a long,
arguably still ongoing period of mutual accommodation between society
and industrial technology. It remains to be seen what will emerge from
this new transitional phase we find ourselves in. As such, the aim of
this paper has been to call for a broader, and more
contextually-sensitive attitude to what might constitute creativity in
an age of human-AI knowledge work.</p>
