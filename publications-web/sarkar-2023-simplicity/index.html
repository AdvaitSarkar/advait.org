<h1>Should Computers Be Easy To Use? Questioning the
Doctrine of Simplicity in User Interface Design</h1>
<p class="author">Advait Sarkar</p>

<div class="abstract">
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>That computers should be easy to learn and use is a rarely-questioned
  tenet of user interface design. But what do we gain from prioritising
  usability and learnability, and what do we lose? I explore how
  simplicity is not an inevitable truth of user interface design, but
  rather contingent on a series of events in the evolution of software.
  Not only does a rigid adherence to this doctrine place an artificial
  ceiling on the power and flexibility of software, but it is also
  culturally relative, privileging certain information cultures over
  others. I propose that for feature-rich software, negotiated complexity
  is a better target than simplicity, and we must revisit the ill-regarded
  relationship between learning, documentation, and software.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" id="the-doctrine-of-simplicity"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> The doctrine of simplicity</h2>
<p>To give the doctrine of simplicity a single definition is difficult,
as it appears in many variants and guises. It encapsulates a certain
ideology and set of values about computer software. It takes the form:
“computers should be easy/natural/simple to use/learn”. A critical
reader will seize upon the many possible combinations of words in the
preceding sentence, and point out that each can be interpreted
differently. “<em>natural</em> to <em>use</em>” is not the same as
“<em>easy</em> to <em>learn</em>”; certainly the design of a user study
to test either proposition will radically differ. I acknowledge these
distinctions and request the reader to indulge this temporary
generalisation, because I hope to make clear that the specific variant
of the doctrine is not critical to the following discussion, rather it
is the ethos that this set of statements encompasses, their origin, and
their implications, that I wish to bring into focus.</p>
<p>A corollary to the doctrine of simplicity is the doctrine of
gradualism, that computer users can be led to difficult concepts via
easier stepping stones. As a design principle, this translates as: at
each incremental stage of the user learning journey, give the user the
smallest necessary amount of learning, information, flexibility, and
power. This is ostensibly inspired by the way in which concepts are
presented in a particular order in a textbook or a school curriculum,
although the idea of “conceptual prerequisites” <span class="citation"
data-cites="griffin1994rightstart">[31]</span>, that some concepts
inherently ‘precede’ others, is a contested pedagogical principle. As
implicit (and sometimes explicit) pedagogues, software and its designers
manifest a particular philosophy of learning and teaching.</p>
<p>A reader who has worked for any period of time in human-computer
interaction research or design will have encountered the doctrines of
simplicity and gradualism. Software design can be even viewed as the
search for metaphors to make hard concepts graspable <span
class="citation" data-cites="blackwell2006reification">[9]</span>.
Similar principles and values are articulated formally and informally in
design theory, design research, and in practice. Let me draw upon a few
examples to demonstrate the point that simplicity and gradualism have
been highly influential ideas in human-computer interaction
research.</p>
<p>Early explainable AI research discovered a limit to the amount of
information in an explanation before the user became overwhelmed <span
class="citation" data-cites="kulesza2013too sarkar2022explainable">[44,
84]</span>. This research formed the partial basis for guidelines for
human-AI interaction design <span class="citation"
data-cites="amershi2019guidelines">[2]</span>. Simplicity is achieved by
limiting the quantity of information presented, or by limiting (or
altering) its quality. Approaches to information limiting in explainable
AI (e.g., “don’t overwhelm” <span class="citation"
data-cites="kulesza2013too">[44]</span>) and in data visualisation
(e.g., “overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand” <span
class="citation" data-cites="shneiderman2003eyes">[89]</span>) are
arguably more focused on quantity, whereas some interfaces apply
qualitative gradualism, using the theory of multiple representations
<span class="citation" data-cites="ainsworth1999functions">[1]</span>,
to guide learners through increasing levels of representational
abstraction <span class="citation"
data-cites="stead2014learning hermans2020hedy sarkar2018calculation">[35,
80, 92]</span>.</p>
<p>In end-user programming and programming education, there is the
concept of an ‘abstraction gradient’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="green1996usability">[30]</span>, along which programming
language features can be arranged from low to high abstraction. Various
projects improve the learnability of programming systems by beginning
the abstraction gradient at a low level <span class="citation"
data-cites="sarkar2016phd">[83]</span>, systematically introducing
syntactic abstractions <span class="citation"
data-cites="hermans2020hedy miller2016gradual">[35, 59]</span>, or using
multiple representations at different levels of abstraction (an approach
rooted in mathematics education) <span class="citation"
data-cites="stead2014learning bau2015pencil sarkar2018calculation ainsworth1999functions">[1,
6, 80, 92]</span>. Petricek characterises “no-code” or “low-code”
programming systems, such as HyperCard, by the “substrates” they offer
to change the software; in general, the larger the scope for change, the
higher the difficulty of operation <span class="citation"
data-cites="petricek_2022">[71]</span>. Successful systems, he argues,
apply gradualism: <em>“[...] the visual environment is structured in
terms of several user levels [...] that gradually unlock more advanced
features of the system. [...] This somewhat reduces the gap [...] that
you need to bridge if you need more complex change, because you are
staying in the same substrate [...] you do not get overwhelmed by all
that is available, as more advanced features are initially
hidden”</em>.</p>
<p>As personal computing grew in the late 1980s and early ’90s,
coinciding with the widespread deployment of graphical user interfaces,
the design of documentation and software help systems became a focus for
HCI research. Key findings from this research would shape attitudes
towards software learnability for decades to come. Carroll and Rosson’s
pioneering work identified the “paradox of the active user” <span
class="citation" data-cites="carroll1987paradox">[14]</span>, who fails
to make progress because they prefer to tinker with the software rather
than read documentation. Rettig proclaimed that <em>Nobody Reads
Documentation</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="rettig1991nobody">[76]</span>. Out of these insights
developed the paradigm of “minimalist instruction” <span
class="citation" data-cites="carroll1990nurnberg">[12]</span> and many
ingenious innovations in graphical user interface design that are taken
for granted today, such as the tooltip <span class="citation"
data-cites="farkas1993role">[22]</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as we will see in the following sections, these
successes also instilled a kind of designer-chauvinist idea that great
design can all but eliminate the need for learning. In <em>Training
Wheels in a User Interface</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="carroll1984training">[13]</span>, a gradualist proposal that
complex features can be gated until users have achieved a certain level
of expertise, Carroll and Carrithers demur about its applicability as a
permanent solution, stating: <em>“a more significant and longer term
goal in system design is that of defining a user interface architecture
with which to confront learnability and training issues, and with which
to eliminate the need to retrofit for learnability in the first
place”</em>.</p>
<p>With the growth of touchscreens, cameras, sensors, and multi-modal
computing, it became possible to control computers through gestures.
Based on the principle that gestures should require as little learning
as possible, in the mid-2000s the field of gesture elicitation studies
emerged <span class="citation"
data-cites="wobbrock2005maximizing">[102]</span>, spawning over 200
studies <span class="citation"
data-cites="villarreal2020systematic">[97]</span> aiming to discover
gestures and symbols so natural that they pre-exist in the user’s
repertoire before they encounter a system at all.</p>
<p>Here I have highlighted a few manifestations of the doctrines of
simplicity and gradualism that I have encountered in my own research. I
believe that many examples besides these can be found in many corners of
human-computer interaction, user experience, and design practice. They
are deeply ingrained in our research practices and widely-used
instruments including the System Usability Scale <span class="citation"
data-cites="brooke1996sus">[10]</span> (cited over 14,000 times) which
includes questions such as <em>“I thought the system was easy to
use”</em> and <em>“I would imagine that most people would learn to use
this system very quickly”</em>, and the NASA TLX cognitive load index
<span class="citation"
data-cites="hart1988development hart2006nasa">[33, 34]</span> (multiple
publications, together cited over 18,000 times), including questions
such as <em>“How much mental and perceptual activity was required (e.g.,
thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)?
Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex, exacting or
forgiving?”</em> and <em>“How hard did you have to work (mentally and
physically) to accomplish your level of performance?”</em> Many
researchers, myself included, rely heavily on these instruments to
evaluate designs. But is it always an indicator of superior design, when
someone can learn to use a system very quickly? Is it always a better
interface where the task is easy, simple, and forgiving, and requires
little “mental and perceptual activity”?</p>
<p>These ideas are almost axiomatic, and seem like unquestionable tenets
of good user interface design. Yet this particular set of values can be
traced back to specific, contingent events in the cultural and
commercial history of computing.</p>

</div>
<p>So far we have briefly encountered the doctrines of simplicity and
gradualism as we know them today, and hopefully the examples above have
shown their pervasive influence in HCI research and practice. The title
of this paper indicates that we will be questioning that influence. As
with any proposal for reform, we risk committing the fallacy of removing
Chesterton’s proverbial fence <span class="citation"
data-cites="chesterton1929thing">[17]</span>, proposing to dissolve an
apparently outmoded institution, only to discover the complex systemic
interactions that necessitated it. Thus it is worth attempting to
understand why and how we got here in the first place. A rough outline
of the discussion that follows is presented in Figure <a
href="#fig:timeline" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:timeline">1</a>.</p>
<p>The first important development in the history of user interface
design was the conceptualization of the textual (algebraic-sentential)
programming language as the basis for instructing computers. In
conceiving of programming as writing code, early computer scientists
implicitly set forth the agenda for interface designers as code being
the underlying complexity that design metaphors ought to abstract away.
But this was scarcely inevitable: Arawjo traces key cultural, commercial
and technical constraints, including institutional directives, the
requirements to retrofit punch card machines and typewriters, and even
aesthetic xenophobia (Frege’s two-dimensional notation was ridiculed as
“Japanese” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mendelsohn2005philosophy">[58]</span>), which led to the
dominance of the sentential paradigm over visual, diagrammatic
alternatives <span class="citation"
data-cites="arawjo2020write">[5]</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, within textual programming languages the view of
programming as operationalised mathematics is only one possibility.
Babbage mostly conceived of programming this way, though Lovelace saw
further, speculating in a celebrated example that programs could be used
to manipulate music <span class="citation"
data-cites="snyder2012philosophical">[90]</span>. Nonetheless, in the
1950s the nascent computer “science” was proximal to many potential
disciplinary homes, from electrical engineering, physics, astronomy, and
biology to communications, espionage, archival, and art. The
mathematisation of computer science (and consequently its principal
working material, the programming language) was a result of computer
science’s struggle for disciplinary legitimacy <span class="citation"
data-cites="ensmenger2012computer">[21]</span>. Eager to be taken
seriously as a science, and eager to capture investment from government
agencies and private enterprise, the discipline aligned itself to the
comforting objectivity and inarguable utility of applied mathematics.
The discipline was gradually so entrenched in this particular episteme
<span class="citation" data-cites="Foucault1966-ey">[25]</span> that it
became virtually impossible to imagine any alternative.</p>
<p>Yet it was in the imagination of an alternative that interface design
emerged. The practice of programming computers began as complex,
requiring manuals and study. The use of language to hold power and
separate classes is a tale that recurs throughout human history. The
Egyptian priestly class kept power through guarded knowledge of the
sacred hieroglyphs, hindu brahmin priests kept power through their rites
and incantations <span class="citation"
data-cites="mosca1939ruling">[61]</span>, catholic priests kept power
over the interpretation of the Bible through their knowledge of
ecclesiastical Latin <span class="citation"
data-cites="jensen1996humanist">[39]</span>, and in modern society, a
new class of scientific priests maintains power through jargon and
institutional gatekeeping <span class="citation"
data-cites="foucault1969archeologie">[24]</span>. The emancipatory era
of the 1960s and ’70s was characterised by the rapid withdrawal of
global colonial powers from physical occupation <span class="citation"
data-cites="duara2004introduction">[20]</span>, tumultuous developments
in attitudes to student empowerment in adult education <span
class="citation" data-cites="vetter2019global freire1968pedagogia">[26,
96]</span>, and the increasing export of American democratic values to
solidify the Western postwar hegemony <span class="citation"
data-cites="nye1990soft">[66]</span>. Swept along amidst these vast
social and political currents, personal computing symbolised the new
information age, and it became apparent that a democratic future was one
in which everyone could use a computer, and that meant democratising the
language of instruction.</p>
<p>It was not just the starry-eyed ideal of liberal democracy that
coaxed computing out of the hands of scientist-priests, but also the
prospect of fabulous wealth. Bill Gates took on the mission to place “a
computer on every desk” <span class="citation"
data-cites="gates2007robot">[28]</span>. Though Xerox did not rise to
the opportunity for commercialising Alan Kay’s visionary research at
PARC <span class="citation" data-cites="myers1998brief">[62]</span>, the
introduction of the graphical user interface in the 1980s by Apple and
Microsoft became the next formative step in the doctrine of simplicity.
Simplicity and its perception became a marketing and competitive
advantage. Apple’s marketing materials focused on the simplicity of the
operating system, lampooned competitor systems as requiring stacks of
heavy manuals,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> later adopting the taglines “there
is no step 3” and “it just works”. Apple’s design interpreted simplicity
as radical minimalism in software and hardware (often at the expense of
actual usability, as noted in the case of the single-button mouse, and
the buttonless iPod shuffle <span class="citation"
data-cites="price_2022">[74]</span>). The adoption of simplicity as a
design principle in this era invoked, sometimes explicitly, a notion of
political superiority. Apple’s famous “1984” ad compared the usability
of the Macintosh to the revolution in an Orwellian communist dystopia
(with IBM, the incumbent giant, in the position of the repressive
state). It has been widely discussed that Steve Jobs’ minimalism, which
spanned his attire, his communication style, and his products, was
heavily influenced by his personal experiences with ascetic Buddhism
<span class="citation"
data-cites="robinson2015appletopia">[78]</span>.</p>
<p>But more important than these explicit politicisations were the
effects that the simplicity shift had on society, research and practice.
Winner sets out two mechanisms by which technology exerts political
influence <span class="citation"
data-cites="winner1980artifacts">[101]</span>, which we can see in the
case of the graphical user interface. First, the specific design
features of a technology or device enable certain forms of power (low
bridges permit only certain vehicles to pass underneath). Second, the
decision to adopt a technology or not, for instance a certain type of
machine, or a certain standard, lends itself to certain forms of power
being invoked because that is what is needed to make the technology work
(a ship’s captain requires absolute authority to manage the control of
the ship in crisis). In the case of the graphical user interface, its
commercial success rapidly eliminated other forms of interface. At the
same time, the power of programmers and the software industry was
consolidated, because while graphical user interfaces were usable, they
were fundamentally restricted; end-users could not describe new
behaviours – you need a programmer for that. End-user programming
research has ever since battled this limitation <span class="citation"
data-cites="ko2011state">[42]</span>, with the development of powerful
paradigms such as programming-by-demonstration <span class="citation"
data-cites="kurlander1993watch">[45]</span> and programming-by-example
<span class="citation" data-cites="lieberman2001your">[51]</span>, and a
few widespread commercial successes, such as the spreadsheet. Yet the
legacy of mathematisation and algebraic-sentential programming still
looms over these efforts; it is still that particular form and vision of
computing that we seek to make more accessible.</p>
<p>Desite Apple’s mockery of manuals, through the 1980s and ’90s most
software still came with manuals, and it was culturally accepted that
some explicit training and learning investment was required to use
computer software. This was reasonable given that a lot of software was
used in a business context, and the longevity of software was high.
Updates were rare and expensive. Due to the distribution bottleneck of
floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and the retail supply chain, software packages
were updated once a year at most. Software was largely sold with a
permanent license, rather than the now-predominant subscription model.
In such a climate, it made sense to approach software as a tool with
relatively fixed behaviour, because time invested in learning had a high
likelihood of a long-term return in productivity.</p>
<p>This began to change in the late 1990s with the World-Wide-Web.
Initially conceived as a method for sending communications and
documents, websites were simple and usable by default — as usable as a
document — to use the Web, one needed only to be able to read and write.
Yet unlike static documents, the Web did have minimal levels of
interaction: links could be clicked, forms could be submitted. From this
humble basis emerged a tidal wave of speculative applications, from
search engines, to news media, to e-commerce. This Wild-Wild-West came
to an abrupt halt with the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2000, when it
became apparent that not just any Internet business would succeed.</p>
<p>A business that had succeeded though, was Google. In the aftermath of
the dot-com bubble a scramble began to discover the formula for success
on the Web. Google’s success, in part, began to be attributed to its
minimalist design, which stood in stark contrast to the “cluttered”
interfaces of its competitors: Yahoo, AltaVista, Lycos, and Ask Jeeves,
which inherited their design from book indexes and print media. This
began a period of intense mythmaking in design culture where simplicity
became conflated with usability, and was exalted as the key to building
commercially successful software. This was the era of Jenson’s <em>The
Simplicity Shift</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="jenson2002simplicity">[40]</span> and Maeda’s <em>Laws of
Simplicity</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="maeda2006laws">[54]</span>. The influential design firm IDEO
began its crusade to instill “design thinking” in every corporation,
having expanded its interests from designing chairs and toothbrushes to
management consultancy <span class="citation"
data-cites="nussbaum_2004">[65]</span>. Products and their designers
began to assume the mantle of instruction manuals and teachers, and a
product that needed effort to learn was not only considered a
commercially inferior prospect, but also reflective of poor design.</p>
<p>The early Web had trained users to expect document-like levels of
simplicity, but in the 2000s, with Flash, Java Applets, and JavaScript,
the interactive potential of Web technologies grew. Social media sites
such as Facebook and Twitter were the great winners of this new Web
ecosystem and it is no coincidence that they remain key players in
advancing infrastructure for enriching web apps, such as React and
Bootstrap. Similarly Google, which did not own a desktop operating
system, poured resources into building Chrome, which subsequently became
the dominant Web browser. Google and other browser vendors, through
their involvement in the W3C consortium and WHATWG groups, pursued key
capabilities in multimedia, local storage, multi-threading, and
high-performance JavaScript, facilitating the functional parity of Web
applications with desktop applications.</p>
<p>Web “sites” to be visited and Web “pages” to be read became Web
“applications” to be used <span class="citation"
data-cites="laurel2013computers">[47]</span>. But while these
applications are as rich, capable, and complex as “native” desktop
software, the cultural expectations of the static Web persist. When
users open an application in a browser, they expect to use it without
investing effort to learn the interface, as though it were a document.
Through gradual enrichment, the designers of web apps became trapped,
like the proverbial frogs in boiling water, between their ambitions for
their software and the expectations of users.</p>
<p>Rich Web applications transformed the status quo of rare updates and
software continuity; the Web enabled instant and continuous deployment
of new features. Mobile operating systems were born into this new regime
and adopted the same model. Through the 2010s, traditional desktop
software also began adopting the continuous deployment engineering model
(and its attendant economic model of subscriptions), facilitated by the
rapid growth of broadband and 3G/4G mobile data networks. With the
benefits of frequent updates came another cultural shift in the value
proposition of investing time and effort into learning software. What if
a feature’s appearance or behaviour changes? What if it is removed? With
software subject to constant change, it becomes difficult to predict
whether effort invested in learning will pay off. This puts further
pressure on software to be simple and self-evident.</p>
<p>The research focus of HCI (and CHI in particular) had aligned itself
with this landscape of discretionary commercial software use, thus
separating it from its predecessor, human factors, which largely
targeted the design of systems used within organizations by employees
with little choice in the matter <span class="citation"
data-cites="grudin2009ai">[32]</span>. Weiser’s research agenda of
ubiquitous computing <span class="citation"
data-cites="weiser1991computer">[100]</span>, a vision of “quiet”,
“invisible”, and “seamless” interfaces, became entrenched as a design
objective. SIGDOC, the ACM special interest group on documentation, home
to much early research on software help systems, was threatened with
obsolescence and rebranded itself as “design of communication” <span
class="citation" data-cites="mehlenbacher2011evolution">[57]</span>.
This accompanied a broader turn in computer science education away from
direct instruction towards constructivist learning, the idea that
computing is best learned through experimentation, not instruction <span
class="citation" data-cites="hermans2018explicit">[36]</span>, which is
reflected in contemporary studies of software skill acquisition <span
class="citation"
data-cites="sarkar2016constructivist sarkar2018spreadsheetlearning sarkar2020spreadsheet">[81,
85, 86]</span>. The practical nature of academic HCI also played a role:
longitudinal studies are hard, single-session lab studies are
(relatively!) easy. Short studies are more conducive to the annual
drumbeat of conference submission cycles. We develop too many new
systems for each to be evaluated in long-term use; the ability to
rapidly test and explore various design spaces is an asset to our
discipline, but it places pressure on design to make its value evident
on the basis of brief and shallow encounters.</p>

</figure>
<p>In this current climate, where users evaluate potential software
purchases and subscriptions within minutes, and impressions of websites
are made in less than a second <span class="citation"
data-cites="lindgaard2006attention">[52]</span>, first impressions of
usability matter and are critical to commercial success. But in certain
cases, this creates a moral hazard to make software appear <em>more
usable</em> by making it <em>less useful</em>. The design of commercial
software aimed at discretionary users has fallen into a Nash equilibrium
which is not Pareto efficient, a situation which most introductions to
game theory illustrate using the example of the prisoner’s dilemma <span
class="citation" data-cites="osborne2004introduction">[69]</span>. Each
prisoner can unilaterally maximise their outcome by confessing, but this
results in a sub-optimal equilibrium, where the optimal solution would
have been for both to cooperate. As in the prisoner’s dilemma, products
optimised for long-term use can lose out to those which appear easier to
use on a preliminary evaluation (Figure <a href="#fig:nash"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:nash">2</a>). This market
environment puts pressure on designers to hyper-optimise for making
products easy to use without learning investment, but which may not
result in the best long-term user experience or empowerment.</p>
<h2 data-number="3" id="what-we-lose-when-software-is-easy"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> What we lose when software is
‘easy’</h2>
<p>In some cases the benefits to users of a competitive market pressure
to make software ‘easy’ are obvious; users clearly stand to gain when a
brilliant metaphor or interface technique makes the same capabilities
available to the user with lower cognitive and learning costs. But what
might they lose when designers adhere to these doctrines?</p>
<p>What about software whose entire purpose is to create radical leaps
in users’ thinking? What if such software requires users to shift their
worldview in order to use it? This might bring to mind sweeping concepts
such as Kuhn’s paradigm shifts <span class="citation"
data-cites="kuhn1970structure">[43]</span>, for instance the transition
away from phlogiston theory in the 1770s with Lavoisier’s isolation of
oxygen. Or Galileo’s shifts in natural interpretations, for instance the
re-evaluation of sense-perception as a source of truth regarding motion
<span class="citation" data-cites="feyerabend2010against">[23]</span>.
Software may even aim to serve as Wittgenstein’s ladder <span
class="citation" data-cites="sep-wittgenstein">[7]</span>, which a
learner must climb only to throw away, achieving an enduring cognitive
extension <span class="citation"
data-cites="hernandez2019ai">[37]</span>.</p>
<p>But we needn’t reach for such extremes: there are many common
examples of concepts, skills, and tools that are hard to learn, which
may take years, and thousands of hours of deliberate practice <span
class="citation" data-cites="anders2008deliberate">[3]</span>, but those
who learn them have transformed themselves and their minds. Mathematics,
language, writing, playing a musical instrument, playing a sport: almost
any human activity worth doing falls into this category.</p>
<p>It might seem like a stretch to draw an analogy between playing a
musical instrument and using software, but in fact some kinds of
software also fall into this category. This includes spreadsheet
software, such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, design software
such as Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk AutoCAD, digital audio workstations
such as Apple’s Logic Pro and Ableton Live. It includes specialist
applications in domains as wide as accounting, urban planning,
architecture, astrophysics; indeed almost every discipline and
profession is served by some unique and distinctive software tools that
form a core and indispensable part of its practice. These applications
are used intensively, and over long periods of time, often entire
careers. Their feature set is vast and complex, and users need to work
to build skills. Often, professional identity and status is deeply
entwined with the skillful use of specific software, resulting in a
fascinating power dynamic between users, software, and its designers
<span class="citation"
data-cites="nouwens2018application sarkar2022end">[64, 82]</span>. Users
develop craft practices, idioms, and pattern languages for using such
software. Such software often has thriving online and offline
communities where expert knowledge is exchanged. While individual
practitioners may make considered software purchase decisions based on
long-term evaluation, even software of this kind is subject to
commercial pressures, as companies seek to expand market share by
capturing casual usage, and increasing the appeal of software in B2B
sales settings, where software procurement decisions are often made by
managerial non-practitioners on behalf of the entire organisation.</p>
<p>As a shorthand, let us call this particular kind of software
<em>praxisware</em>. The term “praxis” is widely used, and often loosely
used simply to mean “practice”. I am drawing particularly from the
notions of praxis due firstly to Sartre <span class="citation"
data-cites="Soper1986-dy">[91]</span>, who situates praxis within
division of labour and for whom praxis constitutes activities that
consolidate and protect class and profession, and secondly to Freire
<span class="citation" data-cites="freire1968pedagogia">[26]</span>, who
situates praxis within education and empowerment and for whom praxis
constitutes activities of “reflection and action directed at [societal]
structures to be transformed”.</p>
<p>It is in praxisware that the tradeoffs between superficial simplicity
and long-term user experience are most acute. This software aims to
facilitate rich and complex activities that are antagonised by the ideal
of simplicity. As Stolterman notes <span class="citation"
data-cites="stolterman2008nature">[93]</span>: <em>“Humans seem to seek
and enjoy certain experiences of complexity. In some contexts,
complexity may be understood as richness, generally found to be a
positive and desired quality. [...] The simpler an environment is, the
easier it is to understand and deal with, but at the same time, the more
it lacks the richness and stimulus that we seem to appreciate and
enjoy”</em>. Norman’s foreword to Laurel’s <em>Computers as Theatre</em>
explains: <span class="citation"
data-cites="laurel2013computers">[47]</span>: <em>“[...] we get the
greatest pleasure from our ability to overcome early failures and
adversaries. If everything runs perfectly and smoothly with no
opportunity to deploy our powers and skills, pleasure is diminished.
Human emotion is sensitive to change; starting low and ending high is a
far better experience than one that is always high. Is this a cry for
deliberate placement of obstacles and confusions? Obviously not, but it
is a cry for a look at the temporal dimensions, at engagement, agency,
and the rise and fall of dramatic tension.”</em></p>
<p>This critique of simplicity echoes previous critiques voiced in
third-wave HCI, which questioned values of ‘seamlessness’ and Weiser’s
idea that technology should be quiet and fade into the background. In
reaction it was pointed out that in some scenarios, ‘seamful’ design
might be preferable, to take advantage of the fact that user activities
often interweave heterogenous media <span class="citation"
data-cites="chalmers2004seamful">[16]</span>. Ambiguity was not
universally to be avoided, but could be drawn upon as a design resource
to create engaging and thought-provoking experiences, and practically
address technological limitations <span class="citation"
data-cites="gaver2003ambiguity">[29]</span>. More recently, with growing
concerns around dispossession and loss of agency to AI algorithms,
researchers have proposed that designs could be deliberately
antagonistic as a societal intervention <span class="citation"
data-cites="hollanek2019non">[38]</span>: <em>“Could ‘non-user-friendly’
design successfully harness the feeling of confusion and dissatisfaction
to raise political awareness, to cause a cognitive glitch?”</em> Eric Li
of the Museum of Modern Art, drawing upon Guy Debord’s concept of derivé
(drifting), conjectures <span class="citation"
data-cites="li_2021">[50]</span>: <em>“But what if we [used] design to
provoke a type of thinking that art has provoked for centuries? [...]
Imagine that, when you go to your browser, the furniture and interface
elements that greet you aren’t there to speed you onto your next
destination on the Web. [...] What if it were filled with a random work
of art? Time slows down [and you] pause, enjoying the sights, before
diving back into the ever-flowing river of information. [...] Perhaps,
like a dérive, not the most direct route, but far more enjoyable. A
breath of air.”</em></p>
<p>Computer games are another genre of software that are often complex,
and have steep learning curves, but are nonetheless tolerated (even
enjoyed) by users and are commercially successful. Researchers have
attempted to understand the efficacy of game tutorials <span
class="citation" data-cites="andersen2012impact">[4]</span>, and
proposed that game heuristics such as challenge, fantasy, and curiosity
might be applied to software design more broadly <span class="citation"
data-cites="malone1982heuristics">[55]</span>. Yet there remains a
fundamental difference: games are <em>experiential</em> software,
interacted with purely for their own sake, where users are intrinsically
motivated to learn. In contrast, productivity software is used as part
of a process that represents and manipulates outcomes external to the
software itself, i.e. in the “real” world. As Laurel puts it,
<em>““Productivity” as a class of applications is better characterized,
not by the concreteness of outcomes, but by their seriousness vis-à-vis
the real world”</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="laurel2013computers">[47]</span>. For this reason, games do
not generally fall into the category of praxisware, and are not subject
to the same historical and commercial influences or cultural
expectations. This does not mean that there is nothing to learn from
game design, but it does mean that we cannot expect that importing
strategies for managing software complexity from games will be
straightforward, or effective.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;">

<p>What is ‘easier’ or ‘harder’ is often a matter of perspective shift
that only comes with expertise of a new paradigm. The enlightenment was
partly fuelled by algebraic mathematical notation that replaced the
earlier form of writing mathematical statements using long-form
naturalistic language sentences <span class="citation"
data-cites="okrent2009land snyder2012philosophical">[68, 90]</span>.
With the benefit of hindsight, algebraic notation clearly made
mathematics easier: symbolic manipulation unlocked efficiencies and
scaffolded thinking in a manner that was simply impossible with the old
notation. But using ordinary language to describe mathematics is also in
some sense easier, because there is no new notation and its attendant
manipulations to learn; this is precisely why it had been used for so
long in the first place. Thus a tool that is initially easier (natural
language sentences) may have a glass ceiling, and a tool that is
initially harder (algebraic notation) can, after a perspective shift,
make subsequent tasks easier.</p>
<p>Even to describe language or writing as “easy” or “intuitive” ignores
the fact that learning to speak and write a language takes years of
practice, something that is apparent to anyone who has tried to learn a
second language after childhood. Chomskians might argue that the
capacity for language is innate, but they will not argue the same for
the ability to speak any <em>particular</em> language. In text entry
research, a language-adjacent corner of human-computer interaction, the
importance of evaluating not the initial usability of a system but
rather its emergent usability over time and learning investment is
well-documented. Researchers reference the “power law” of learning (or
practice) <span class="citation"
data-cites="newell1981mechanisms">[63]</span> which describes how a
user’s proficiency improves over time, with practice and learning. Ward
et al. propose that the slope of this curve, rather than the intercept,
is a superior indicator of a text entry system’s quality <span
class="citation" data-cites="ward2000dasher">[99]</span>. At the same
time, it is acknowledged that the commercial acceptance of such systems
hinges on first-use and early-use experience (i.e., the intercept) <span
class="citation" data-cites="mackenzie1999text">[53]</span>. Text entry
is a microcosm that reflects the simplicity trap.</p>
<p>O’Hara et al. critique the rhetoric of “naturalness” that pervades
research in touchless user interfaces <span class="citation"
data-cites="ohara2013naturalness">[67]</span>, finding that rather than
being a <em>“representation of our gesture”</em> and the <em>“ability to
infer intent”</em> to facilitate the <em>“exchange of information”</em>,
naturalness arises from <em>“the practices of specific communities in
particular social settings [...] we need to approach the design of these
systems in terms of how they might allow a beneficial reconfiguration of
practices and how we experience the world in new ways
accordingly.”</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In the case of praxisware, notions
of objective simplicity and information exchange are antagonistic to the
community-based and often professionalised nature of its use.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;">

<p>The ideal of simplicity as a goal for software design is culturally
relative. Simplicity is interpreted and enacted at several levels of
software design, from aesthetic, to functional, to the conceptualisation
and unitisation of the user experience across a computing platform.</p>
<div class="figure*">

<p>An example of aesthetic notions of simplicity differing can be found
in Japanese web design. Websites aimed at Japanese audiences are often
dense with information and text (Figure <a href="#fig:japanese"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:japanese">3</a>). Visitors whose
primary experience is of contemporary Euro-American Web design often
perceive it as “cluttered”, and far from simple. But this evaluation
applies an inappropriate measure of simplicity. Japanese web design
reflects cultural, technical and linguistic differences, encompassing
considerations such as the logographic nature of kanji and low-bandwidth
mobile data connections <span class="citation"
data-cites="wake_2016 themarketingsamurai_2018 david_2013">[19, 79,
98]</span>. Japan’s sociotechnocultural environment identifies
simplicity with legibility and information richness <span
class="citation" data-cites="rean_2020 mcgowan_2018">[56, 75]</span>.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Contrast this with the Euro-American
identification of simplicity with whitespace and low information per
“screenful”, typified by websites such as Medium.com. Here the
transformation of the Western information aesthetic from print to
digital media via the dot-com crisis is clear; Europe had its own long
tradition of dense texts (one need only look at the pages of medieval
manuscripts, decorated and inscribed in every available space to
maximise the precious vellum), which did not survive the transition to
the Western Web.</p>
<p>While consumers wish for simple tools, they cannot wish for simple
tasks. The challenges and ambitions of work and life are irreducibly
complex, and to this we aim to apply simple, intuitive tools. These two
forces are in tension, and in the West they have resulted in a
“toolbelt” style of computing <span class="citation"
data-cites="sumner1997evolution">[94]</span>. This has roots as far back
as the UNIX design philosophy that <em>“A UNIX program should do one
thing well, and leave unrelated tasks to other programs”</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="pike1984program">[72]</span>. The idea is
that each individual piece of software remains small, modular, and
robust, but can be composed with others: a workflow that mirrors the
epistemic process of pure mathematics. This mathematico-computational
view of working is supremely appropriate for mathematicians, but less so
for other domains, as acknowledged in Lenat’s humility-laden note on
<em>Why AM and EURISKO appear to work</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="lenat1984and">[49]</span>. In the late 1990s, Sumner and
Stolze characterised this as ushering in the “toolbelt era” <span
class="citation" data-cites="sumner1997evolution">[94]</span>, where
most complex daily tasks require the coordinated use of several pieces
of software, with often jarring frictions and disconnects as the
activity transitions between tools. The picture has not changed at the
time of writing. Even in praxisware, which often aims to contain as
large a portion of common and professional workflows as possible, it is
often observed how auxiliary tools are used to finesse, subvert,
combine, marshall, and supplement the information workflow in
conjunction with the “primary” tool <span class="citation"
data-cites="chalhoub2022freedom larsen2020collaborative">[15,
46]</span>, with ensuing frictions.</p>
<p>The toolbelt philosophy, in turn, puts pressure on knowledge work to
accommodate its tendency for modularisation and simplification, thus
contributing to a Marxian breakdown of knowledge work <span
class="citation" data-cites="fuchs2014digital">[27]</span>, nudging it
in a direction where people only click buttons for small-scope machines
to perform simple “mimeomorphic” actions <span class="citation"
data-cites="collins1998shape">[18]</span>. A genre of software that has
already reached this extreme is social media and recommender systems,
where the loss of user agency is well-documented. Žižek (via Pfaller)
describes these as “interpassive” <span class="citation"
data-cites="zizek1998interpassive">[103]</span> (by irreverent contrast
to inter<em>active</em>), giving the user only the slightest illusion of
control while scrolling through their Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok
feeds, while in practice any given user’s experience is driven entirely
by the algorithm <span class="citation"
data-cites="hollanek2019non">[38]</span>. The simplification of
knowledge work is accompanied by a shift in emphasis from production to
consumption. Praxisware concerns itself inherently with production, thus
the doctrine of simplicity antagonises its relationship with information
and knowledge.</p>
<p>The Chinese software landscape, through a combination of government
policy and domestic grit, has developed a compelling alternative to the
toolbelt. Known as “superapps”, platforms such as WeChat encompass,
connect, and consolidate wide-ranging functions including
communications, payment, and numerous retail and service verticals. As
Lee describes <span class="citation" data-cites="lee2018ai">[48]</span>:
<em>“In effect, WeChat has taken on the functionality of Facebook,
iMessage, Uber, Expedia, eVite, Instagram, Skype, PayPal, Grubhub,
Amazon, LimeBike, WebMD, and many more. It isn’t a perfect substitute
for any one of those apps, but it can perform most of the core functions
of each, with frictionless mobile payments already built in. This all
marks a stark contrast to the “app constellation” model in Silicon
Valley in which each app sticks to a strictly prescribed set of
functions.”</em> Moreover, the organisation of these firms acknowledges
that information technology is only one participant in a larger world
where tasks, goods and services involve flesh and oil: <em>“American
internet companies tend to take a “light” approach [...] sharing
information, closing knowledge gaps, and connecting people digitally.
[...] In China, companies tend to go “heavy.” They don’t want to just
build the platform—they want to recruit each seller, handle the goods,
run the delivery team, supply the scooters, repair those scooters, and
control the payment.”</em> The Chinese example puts a twist on
“appropriate technology” <span class="citation"
data-cites="schumacher2011small">[87]</span>, a well-intentioned concept
often invoked as an epithet meaning “cheap technology for poor people”,
showing that that it is not only the material basis of technology, but
also its ideology (such as its aesthetics of simplicity) that may be
culturally inappropriate.</p>
<p>Examining the foundations of the doctrine of simplicity also reveals
cracks. In particular, the inherent universalism in the “paradox of the
active user”, the idea that users overwhelmingly prefer to
learn-by-doing, that they do not wish to invest time in learning, and
that “nobody reads documentation”, is simply false. In her pioneering
work with the GenderMag framework <span class="citation"
data-cites="burnett2016gendermag">[11]</span>, Margaret Burnett and her
collaborators drew evidence from dozens of studies to show that
individuals have a variety of information processing and learning
styles. Some indeed prefer to tinker, and learn by doing, eager to seek
immediate visible progress. Others are slow and methodical, tend to seek
help from others, and look for information and training. GenderMag
catalogues these differences and shows that certain styles of learning
and information processing are more common in certain demographic
segments, with a particular focus on gender. The astonishing and
illuminating conclusion is that in privileging certain information
processing styles over others, designers introduce gender bias into
software. As such, software design in a regime where learning-by-doing
is prioritised at the expense of help, documentation, manuals, and
training, also introduces biases. There is another chapter to the
history outlined in Section <a href="#sec:history"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:history">2</a>: it was in
1984, amidst the birth of personal computing, that computer science
developed its gaping gender disparity <span class="citation"
data-cites="kenney_henn_2014">[41]</span>. Why? Analyses point to a
feedback loop seeded by the commercialisation strategy adopted by
companies at the time: to sell computers to children as toys. But toy
advertising is notoriously gendered, and in this precise moment, the
industry “picked a side” and decided that computing was for boys <span
class="citation" data-cites="misa2011gender">[60]</span>, setting off a
cascade of downstream effects where women entered computing majors with
much less prior experience than their peers identifying as men. Thus
each time a new, more democratic (and therefore lucrative) generation of
interface arises, commercial pressures intercede to privilege retail
success over user experience, excluding whoever need be. And so the
market pressure for simplicity exerts normative and exclusionary effects
on praxisware and its communities.</p>
<h2 data-number="4"
id="towards-a-doctrine-of-negotiated-complexity"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Towards a doctrine of negotiated
complexity</h2>
<p>In the genesis of the minimal learning paradigm, researchers had
already identified that the tension between investing in learning
materials, versus investing in simplicity by design, would be a problem
for praxisware. In 1995, Sellen and Nicol concluded <span
class="citation" data-cites="sellen1995building">[88]</span>: <em>“The
distinction between on-line help [i.e., interactive documentation] and
the user interface is not necessarily clear-cut. [...] The aim should be
to provide simple, self-explanatory interfaces. Although the ideal is
commendable, reaching it seems unrealistic at the moment, especially
considering the imbalance between the power and flexibility that much
contemporary software affords and the state of the art in intelligent
interfaces.”</em></p>
<p>Nearly thirty years later, it is clear that just advancing the “state
of the art in intelligent interfaces” is unlikely to ever be sufficient
for tackling the “power and flexibility” of praxisware. One design
response attempting to bridge the obvious dissonance has been the rise
of “in-app teaching”, such as call-outs and dialogs announcing and
explaining new features. Yet these still suffer from the cultural
hangover of minimal learning, and often are heavily constrained in the
amount of information they present to the user. Competing for attention
in a digital landscape overloaded with notifications <span
class="citation" data-cites="Toffler1970-kq biskjaer2016taking">[8,
95]</span>, these simple interventions are often ignored entirely.</p>
<p>A deeper limitation of in-app teaching is the premise that users need
to learn just-in-time, when they are at their computers to perform a
specific task. This is a powerful form of learning because it can take
advantage of the intrinsic motivation and context to complete a
particular task, but can be inhibited by the same need, if the
opportunity to learn is seen as a distraction. The success or failure of
such interventions hinges on accurately modelling the user’s current
knowledge as well as their intent, both of which are exquisitely
challenging.</p>
<p>The alternative is for the user to learn ahead of time, perhaps with
the background context of a set of certain domain-relevant tasks, but
where the tasks are not ends in themselves. This shifts learning from
being task-oriented to being capability- or vision-oriented. Knowing
what can be done, an <em>awareness of the possible</em>, empowers users
in entirely different ways. As Rittel and Webber note <span
class="citation" data-cites="rittel1973dilemmas">[77]</span>, conceiving
a problem in a certain way prefigures its solution. It shifts the nature
of the task itself. A spreadsheet user who knows <em>a priori</em> how
to write formulas will approach the same task differently from one who
does not; starting with planning the data that must go in the
spreadsheet and structuring it appropriately <span class="citation"
data-cites="chalhoub2022freedom">[15]</span>. By the time the
spreadsheet is open and ready, the “task” has already taken on a vastly
different nature for the two users. And on a moment-by-moment basis, the
patchwork of methods and available options explored by each user is also
radically different, shaped by their differing awareness of
possibilities adjacent to the current state of their spreadsheet <span
class="citation" data-cites="pandita2018no">[70]</span>. Ahead of time,
task-independent learning complements the just-in-time approach to
facilitate these shifts in awareness and task conceptualisation.</p>
<p>The fact that <em>some</em> users are willing to invest time and
effort into learning is already documented, but assumed to be rare and
not reflective of mainstream behaviour, and relying on this willingness
is seen as a risk to commercial success. However, recent trends on the
social media platforms TikTok and Instagram reveal that the desire for
ahead of time learning might be far more widespread than previously
thought. I am referring to the meteoric rise of praxisware influencers,
who present short tutorials on complex software such as Excel or
Photoshop, often accompanied by jaunty tunes and dancing (as per the
TikTok vernacular style), some of whom have followers numbering in
<em>millions</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="press-reynolds_2021">[73]</span>. Unlike a platform like
YouTube, where tutorials can actively be searched for and watched on
demand, the engagement patterns of TikTok and Instagram are those of
passive, serendipitous consumption. Why would millions of people follow
a TikTok influencer who teaches Excel? It is not because they expect to
stumble upon a video that will help them with a task they’re currently
working on. It is because in moments of passive consumption, on the
sofa, on the commute, they expect to benefit from ahead of time
learning, and enhancing their awareness of the possible. These millions
of subscribers are strong evidence of the mainstream desire, and
acceptance, of learning investment for praxisware.</p>
<p>We must re-evaluate our attitude to tutorials, learning materials,
and the user learning journey, and reconsider their position as a key
part of interface design. We must also re-evaluate our attitude to the
ideals of simplicity in software use. In this paper I have proposed that
“easy to use” is an inappropriate criterion for evaluating complex,
feature-rich praxisware. This is a call for <em>negotiated
complexity</em>, complexity in software which arises as the result of
optimisation for intensive, long-term use, in consultation with
communities of practitioners, shielded from commercial pressure to
design for first impressions, and with the unapologetic assumption that
users will invest months, or years, in ahead of time learning and
deliberate practice. Complexity is negotiated as the acceptable
trade-off between time invested in learning a tool and the resultant
power it gives the practitioner. Complexity is negotiated between
designers and practitioners over long-term use, not fixed, and evolves
with the needs of the community. The agenda for negotiated complexity in
praxisware has among its implications for research and design the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rather than usability as a universal property of a user interface
with respect to some notion of what a monolithic user might find
‘intuitive’ and ‘natural’, we define usability as a function of an
interface paired with well-designed learning and instructional
materials.</p></li>
<li><p>We consider investment in learning and instruction as a
first-class citizen that participates with and complements the design of
the system.</p></li>
<li><p>We reward longitudinal research that engages seriously with
practitioner communities, and accommodate it within the academic cycle,
perhaps by developing new methods for evaluating the contribution of an
ongoing longitudinal study, or new tracks that prioritise such
work.</p></li>
<li><p>We begin to shift customer culture, when appropriate, to redress
the adverse commercial incentives for simplicity, and to save ourselves
from the prisoner’s dilemma. While this may seem challenging, loci of
deliberate learning such as TikTok seem like a good place to
start.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this paper, I have described the doctrine of simplicity, which has
come to be a dominant ideal in user interface research and design. By
tracing key events in the history of computing and design research, I
have attempted to explain how this ideal has taken hold, at least in the
West. Such ideals create a self-sustaining market pressure that often
countermands the design of complex, feature-rich software. Such
software, termed praxisware, has several properties which cause it to be
vulnerable to the doctrine of simplicity. For praxisware, a better ideal
to aim for is negotiated complexity, considering user learning as part
and parcel of user interface design.</p>
