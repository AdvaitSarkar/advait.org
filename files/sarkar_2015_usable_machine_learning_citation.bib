    abstract={In the 21st century, it is common for people of many professions to have interesting datasets to which machine learning models may be usefully applied. However, they are often unable to do so due to the lack of usable tools for statistical non-experts. We present a line of research into using the spreadsheet -- already familiar to end-users as a paradigm for data manipulation -- as a usable interface which lowers the statistical and computing knowledge barriers to building and using these models.},
