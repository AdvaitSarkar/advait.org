    abstract={Information visualisation presents powerful techniques for data analytics. However, rendering visualisations of big datasets is impractical on commodity hardware. There is increasing interest in approaches where data sampling and probabilistic algorithms are used to support faster processing of large datasets. This approach to approximate computation has not yet paid close attention to the way that approximate visualisations are perceived and employed by human users, as a specific variety of diagrammatic convention. Our intent is to apply this understanding of approximate visualisations as a diagrammatic class to mainstream data science and information visualisation research.},
