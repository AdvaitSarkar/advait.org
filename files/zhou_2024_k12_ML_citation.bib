abstract = {Despite significant advances in machine learning (ML) applications within science, there is a notable gap in its integration into K-12 education to enhance data literacy and scientific inquiry (SI) skills. To address this gap, we enable K-12 teachers with limited technical expertise to apply ML for pattern discovery and explore how ML can empower educators in teaching SI. We design a web-based tool, ML4SI, for teachers to create ML-supported SI learning activities. This tool can also facilitate collecting data about the interaction between ML techniques and SI learning. A pilot study with three K-12 teachers provides insights to prepare the next generation for the era of big data through ML-supported SI learning.},
