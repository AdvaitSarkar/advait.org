abstract = {Prompting generative AI effectively is challenging for users, particularly in expressing context for comprehension tasks like explaining spreadsheet formulas, Python code, and text passages. Through a formative survey (n = 38), we uncovered a trade-off between standardized but predictable prompting support, and context-adaptive but unpredictable support. We explore this trade-off by implementing two prompt middleware approaches: Dynamic Prompt Refinement Control (Dynamic PRC), which generates UI elements for prompt refinement based on the userâ€™s specific prompt, and Static Prompt Refinement Control (Static PRC), which offers generic controls. Our controlled user study (n = 16) showed that the Dynamic PRC approach afforded more control, lowered barriers to providing context, and encouraged task exploration and reflection, but reasoning about the effects of generated controls on the final output remains challenging. Our findings suggest that dynamic prompt middleware can improve the user experience of generative AI workflows.},
