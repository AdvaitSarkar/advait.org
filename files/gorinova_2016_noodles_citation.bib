abstract={Data wrangling is the term used by data scientists for the work of re-organising data into a new structure, before work starts on reporting or analysis. We present a prototype that applies programming by example methods to data wrangling in spreadsheets. The Data Noodles system guides the user through constructing a simple example that illustrates how they would like their spreadsheet to look. A transformation program is then synthesised and executed to produce the final reshaped spreadsheet.},
