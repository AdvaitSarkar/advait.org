abstract = {In this workshop we investigate “alternative futures” of programming with generative-AI tools. The workshop aims to establish a strand of HCI research on the future of AI-supported programming that goes beyond the current focus on usability and performance of GenAI-assisted programming tools, to instead explore radical re-conceptualizations of co-coding and co-creation with AI. The workshop is open to researchers and practitioners engaged in critically exploring novel ways of coding and interacting with AI-based programming tools. We encourage speculative design inquiries exploring prototypes, and provocations that facilitate engagement with a wider spectrum of human skills, experiences and ways of knowing when programming with AI.&nbsp; The workshop welcomes contributions that i) present examples of novel interaction, empirical studies or prototypes of AI-based programming, ii) re-conceptualize how programming with AI-based tools may be conducted and designed for, iii) reflect on values and ethical challenges of AI-based programming.},
