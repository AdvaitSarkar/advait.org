abstract = {AI shaming is a social phenomenon in which negative judgements are associated with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This includes comparing someone’s work with AI-generated work as a means of disparagement, voicing suspicion or alleging that someone has used AI to undermine their reputation, or blaming the poor quality of an artefact on AI use. Common justifications of AI shaming include recourse to AI’s societal harms, its technical limitations, and lack of creativity. I argue that, more fundamentally than any of these, AI shaming arises from a class anxiety induced in middle class knowledge workers, and is a form of boundary work to maintain class solidarity and limit mobility into knowledge work. I discuss the role of AI shaming in protecting the privileged class of knowledge work and its attendant harms.},
