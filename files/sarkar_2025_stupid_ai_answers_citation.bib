abstract = {Artificial Intelligence is a multiple Nobel prize-winning technology that has solved elusive problems such as playing Go and protein folding. It also tells you to eat one small rock per day. Much collective online mirth and criticism has ensued following the discovery of such stupid behaviour.I argue that these stupid answers are in fact correct, because the primary objective of such queries is not to actually receive a correct answer, but rather to obtain an artefact of discourse. I analyse their operation to explain how discussants collectively construct an imagined user who is deceived by the stupid answer, while distancing themselves from that na\"{\i}vety. This discourse operates as a form of spectacle, simulation, and myth in discussions of technology and society.I suggest that researchers avoid invoking stupid AI answers as rhetorical devices in research discourse, as this can undermine genuine AI risks and failures.},
