		<p>Hello! I'm a researcher at Microsoft, an affiliated lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and honorary lecturer at University College London.</p>

		<p>I study: (1) how to design human interfaces for artificial intelligence, and (2) how to help people program and interact with data. The two have more in common than you'd think! <a href="publications.html">All publications&rarr;</a></p>

	<h2>The future of spreadsheets</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		
		<p>My research expands the boundaries of spreadsheet technology. Did you know that spreadsheets can be used to <a href="files/sarkar_2015_machine_learning_spreadsheets.pdf">build machine learning models</a>, or to <a href="files/mattinson_2020_excello.pdf">compose and perform music</a>?</p>

		<p>I've shown how <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2018-calcview">viewing spreadsheet formulas as textual programs</a> can improve efficiency and reduce errors, how to <a href="files/joharizadeh_2020_gridlets.pdf">re-use spreadsheet grids</a> in a more user-friendly manner, how to help users <a href="files/lau_2021_tweakit.pdf">apply Python code</a> in spreadsheets, how spreadsheets can be used to <a href="files/gorinova_2016_noodles.pdf">script database transformations</a>, and how to make <a href="files/williams_2020_inferring_units.pdf">spreadsheets understand units</a> such as metres, dollars, and kilograms.</p>

		<p>In studying spreadsheet users, I've found that people learn to use spreadsheets <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2018-spreadsheet-learning">informally and socially</a>, but there are <a href="files/xia_2024_spreadsheet_knowledge.pdf">barriers to informal knowledge sharing</a>; that they <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2021/11/17/revealing-the-hidden-guesswork-of-spreadsheet-comprehension/">frequently rely on guesswork</a> to understand the spreadsheets of others, that <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2020-spreadsheet-experience/">programming experience is related</a> to spreadsheet experience, that there are good reasons for users to have <a href="files/chalhoub_2022_data_structuring.pdf">"unstructured" data</a> in spreadsheets.</p>

	<h2>Interaction design, AI, and society</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<img src="img/blur-bot-boxes.jpg">

		<p>I'm interested in many aspects of how humans interact with artificial intelligence, and the implications for technology and society.</p>
			
		<p> I have explained that <a href="files/sarkar_2023_human_ai_collaboration.pdf">"human-AI collaboration" is a poor metaphor</a> that is unfair to the data workers of the Global South. My students and I have found that people are <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/12/03/people-reluctant-to-use-self-driving-cars-survey-shows/">reluctant to adopt</a> self-driving cars, that conversations with a chatbot therapist are <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/11/04/talking-to-a-bot-might-help-with-depression-but-you-wont-enjoy-the-conversation/">not very enjoyable</a>, and that speaking conversationally in natural language is probably <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/11/14/human-language-isnt-the-best-way-to-chat-with-siri-or-alexa-probably/">not the ideal way</a> to interact with voice assistants. Moreover, when programming an intelligent system (such as a recommender system), it's probably better to allow users to specify <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/12/18/tell-dont-show-how-to-teach-ai/">rules, rather than feedback</a> such as like/dislike.</p>

		<p>I've found that <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/11/28/ask-people-to-order-things-not-score-them/">asking people to order</a> (rank) things, rather than scoring them, is a faster and more accurate way of measuring human judgment, in domains ranging from <a href="files/sarkar_2016_setwise.pdf">multiple sclerosis assessment</a>, to <a href="files/gooding_2019_word_complexity.pdf">word complexity</a>. This is important for machine learning systems that are trained on such human judgments.</p>

	<h2>Data visualisation</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<p>I've created several visualisation tools, including one for analysing <a href="files/sarkar_2016_gatherminer.pdf">patterns of faults in the British Telecom network</a>. The design, which significantly reduces the expertise required to analyse large time series datasets, has won <a href="https://human-se.github.io/vlhcc2016/best-paper-award-and-honourable-mention">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.csar.org.uk/student-awards/2017/advait-sarkar/">awards</a> and is now available as an <a href="https://github.com/AdvaitSarkar/Gatherminer">open-source</a> online tool.</p>

	<h2>Human interaction with Generative AI</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<p>Generative AI is a term for tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Dall-E, Midjourney, etc. My recent research focuses on understanding how this technology affects cognition, knowledge work, organisations, and society, and designing new ways to use Generative AI.</p>

		<p>I've shown that <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2023-ai-knowledge-work.html">whether AI can be creative</a> is an ill-posed question that can be answered in multiple ways. My colleagues and I have found that Generative AI introduces <a href="files/tankelevitch_2024_GenAI_metacognition.pdf">new metacognitive demands</a> (i.e., thinking about thinking) on knowledge workers. I've therefore proposed that AI can play the role of <a href="files/sarkar_2024_AI_provocateur_PREPRINT.pdf">provocateur</a>, with the aim of improving human <a href="files/sarkar_2024_GenAI_critical.pdf">critical thinking</a>, and fostering greater <a href="files/sarkar_2024_intention.pdf">intentionality</a>.</p>

		<p>I've developed a <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2023-eup-generative-ai/">working definition for Generative AI</a> to create clarity and rigour around this misused and misunderstood term. <!-- The possibility that Generative AI will lead to a rapid acceleration in the scope and frequency of automation is the <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2023-eup-generative-ai/">generative shift hypothesis</a>. --> Though Generative AI can produce code from natural language, I've enumerated <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2023-eup-generative-ai/">potential reasons</a> for end-user programmers to continue using "traditional" programming languages. I've found that <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2022-programming-ai/">programming with Generative AI assistance</a> (e.g., GitHub Copilot) is an entirely new experience, albeit with similarities to programming via search and reuse, compilation, and programming via specification.</p>

		<p>I've explained why, in general, we <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2022-explainable.html">cannot explain the behaviour</a> of large language models, and especially why they <a href="publications-web/sarkar-2024-llms-cannot-explain.html">can't explain their own behaviour</a>.</p>

	<h2>Government policy and outreach</h2>

		<p>I am an advisor to the UK government, other national governments, and regulatory bodies on matters relating to technology, society, automation, and data. <a href="professional.html">My policy work&rarr;</a> has brought me within a single degree of separation from many heads of state, including current US president Joe Biden.</p>

		<!-- p>I believe in universal and free access to technologies such as search, email and mapping, which should be built and operated as public-private partnerships. I also believe that most jobs categorised as 'knowledge work', and many so-called 'service sector' jobs (which are not actually services, and which create the false impression that the sector is rapidly growing) are in fact unnecessary. This is a tremendous waste of societal resources that could otherwise be used for creative, artistic, intellectual pursuits, and social work.</p -->

		<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmIox68Y_FM">my TEDx talk</a> (2018), I explained the theory of AI design I developed during <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-920.pdf">my PhD</a>. In brief: (1) programming is about specifying behaviour, (2) AI is like programming (except for two key differences, which make it a black box), and (3) certain design principles are the solution to the black box problem.</p>

	<h2>Teaching and internships</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<p>Since 2017 I have co-taught <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2324/P342/">Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence</a> (formerly titled "Interaction with Machine Learning"), an advanced design course for the Cambridge MPhil in computer science. It was the world's first (and for some time, the only) graduate course that trained students to build and evaluate user interfaces for machine learning systems.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subBox">
		<p>I've had the privilege of supervising many excellent undergraduate, Master's and PhD students, and research interns at Microsoft. <a href="teaching.html">My students&rarr;</a> have a track record of proceeding to further studies and positions at top institutions and companies. Reach out if you want to work with me!</p>

		<p>Supervisions are an ancient teaching system used by Cambridge and Oxford, in which students interact in very small groups (usually 2 or 3) with a subject tutor. I used to supervise many undergraduate courses at Cambridge, and wrote <a href="files/sarkar-cambridge-supervisions.html">a short book</a> about my experiences &mdash; to my knowledge, the only contemporary published account of an Oxbridge supervisor.</p>

</div> <!-- end of outermost row div -->

<!--
<p>Regarding the future of humanity, I use design as a tool to probe questions such as: what is the limit of automation? How can artificial intelligence augment human capability? How should we define humanity and identity? What are the moral, ethical, and socio-economic implications of advanced artificial intelligence?</p>

<p>Regarding universal data literacy, my aim is to improve the usability and accessibility of tools for sophisticated analytics, which involves data management, statistics, and machine learning. I do this by strategically combining theories of interaction and visual representation, with artificial intelligence and machine learning, to produce novel analytics systems that are easier to use.</p> 

<p>I am also interested in live coding, computer music, psychology of programming, applied machine learning, transport research, and bibliometrics.</p>
