		<p>Hello! I'm a researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge and an affiliated lecturer of computer science at the University of Cambridge.</p>

		<p>I study: (1) how to design human interfaces for artificial intelligence, and (2) how to help people program and interact with data. The two have more in common than you'd think! <a href="publications.html">All publications&rarr;</a></p>
		
		<!-- p>In 2016 I completed my PhD in computer science at the University of Cambridge, as a member of the marvellous <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/">Graphics and Interaction Group</a> ("Rainbow"). I was jointly supervised by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/">Alan Blackwell</a>, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/">Mateja Jamnik</a>, and <a href="https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=10741">Martin Spott</a>. Prior to that, I completed my BA and MEng in computer science, also at Cambridge, in 2012 and 2013 respectively.</p -->

	<h2>The future of spreadsheets</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		
		<p>My research expands the boundaries of spreadsheet technology. Did you know that spreadsheets can be used to <a href="files/sarkar_2015_machine_learning_spreadsheets.pdf">build machine learning models</a>, or to <a href="files/mattinson_2020_excello.pdf">compose and perform music</a>?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subBox">
		<img src="img/calcview.png">
		<p>I've shown how <a href="files/sarkar_2018_calcview.pdf">viewing spreadsheet formulas as textual programs</a> can improve efficiency and reduce errors, how to <a href="files/joharizadeh_2020_gridlets.pdf">re-use spreadsheet grids</a> in a more user-friendly manner, how to help users <a href="files/lau_2021_tweakit.pdf">apply Python code</a> in spreadsheets, how spreadsheets can be used to <a href="files/gorinova_2016_noodles.pdf">script database transformations</a>, and how to make <a href="files/williams_2020_inferring_units.pdf">spreadsheets understand units</a> such as metres, dollars, and kilograms.</p>

		<img src="img/iseup_2020_logo.png" style="width:15%">
		<p>In studying spreadsheet users, I've found that people learn to use spreadsheets <a href="files/sarkar_2018_spreadsheet_learning.pdf">informally and socially</a>, that they <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/spreadsheet-comprehension-guesswork-giving-up-and-going-back-to-the-author/">frequently rely on guesswork</a> to understand the spreadsheets of others, and that <a href="files/sarkar_2020_spreadsheet_experience.pdf">programming experience is related</a> to spreadsheet experience.</p>

	<h2>Interaction design, AI, and society</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<img src="img/blur-bot-boxes.jpg">

		<p>I'm interested in many aspects of how humans interact with artificial intelligence, and the implications for technology and society. My students and I have found that people are <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/12/03/people-reluctant-to-use-self-driving-cars-survey-shows/">reluctant to adopt</a> self-driving cars, that conversations with a chatbot therapist are <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/11/04/talking-to-a-bot-might-help-with-depression-but-you-wont-enjoy-the-conversation/">not very enjoyable</a>, and that speaking conversationally in natural language is probably <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/11/14/human-language-isnt-the-best-way-to-chat-with-siri-or-alexa-probably/">not the ideal way</a> to interact with voice assistants. Moreover, when programming an intelligent system (such as a recommender system), it's probably better to allow users to specify <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/12/18/tell-dont-show-how-to-teach-ai/">rules, rather than feedback</a> such as like/dislike.</p>

		<img src="img/boy-holding-block-toy.jpg">

		<p>I've found that <a href="https://advaitsarkar.wordpress.com/2019/11/28/ask-people-to-order-things-not-score-them/">asking people to order</a> (rank) things, rather than scoring them, is a faster and more accurate way of measuring human judgment, in domains ranging from <a href="files/sarkar_2016_setwise.pdf">multiple sclerosis assessment</a>, to <a href="files/gooding_2019_word_complexity.pdf">word complexity</a>. This is important for machine learning systems that are trained on such human judgments.</p>

	<h2>Data visualisation</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<p>I've created several visualisation tools, including one for analysing <a href="files/sarkar_2016_gatherminer.pdf">patterns of faults in the British Telecom network</a>. The design, which significantly reduces the expertise required to analyse large time series datasets, has won <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2016/best-paper-award-and-honourable-mention">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.csar.org.uk/student-awards/2017/advait-sarkar/">awards</a> and is now available as an <a href="https://github.com/AdvaitSarkar/Gatherminer">open-source</a> online tool.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subBox">
		<p>I've studied how to use <a href="files/sarkar_2015_uncertainty_vis.pdf">error bars as a control mechanism</a> (not just to display uncertainty), how <a href="files/marasoiu_2016_sketching.pdf">data 'sketching'</a> facilitates conversations between analysts, and how we might <a href="files/chander_2016_gaze_lens.pdf">navigate data using just our eyes</a>, without a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen!</p>

	<h2>Government policy and outreach</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<p>I am an advisor to the UK government, other national governments, and regulatory bodies on matters relating to technology, society, automation, and data. <a href="professional.html">My policy work&rarr;</a> has brought me within a single degree of separation from many heads of state, notably current US president Joe Biden.</p>

		<p>I believe in universal and free access to technologies such as search, email and mapping, which I think should be built and operated as public-private partnerships. I also believe that most jobs categorised as 'knowledge work', and many so-called 'service sector' jobs (which are not actually services, and which create the false impression that the sector is rapidly growing) are in fact unnecessary. This is a tremendous waste of societal resources that could otherwise be used for creative, artistic, intellectual pursuits, and social work.</p>

		<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmIox68Y_FM">my TEDx talk</a> (2018), I explained the theory of AI design I developed during <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-920.pdf">my PhD</a>. In brief: (1) programming is about specifying behaviour, (2) AI is like programming (except for two key differences, which make it a black box), and (3) certain design principles are the solution to the black box problem.</p>

	<h2>Teaching and internships</h2>
	<div class="subBox">
		<p>Since 2017 I have co-taught <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/P230">Interaction with Machine Learning</a>, an advanced design course for the Cambridge MPhil in computer science. It was the world's first (and for some time, the only) graduate course that trained students to build and evaluate user interfaces for machine learning systems.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subBox">
		<p>I've had the privilege of supervising many excellent undergraduate, Master's and PhD students, and research interns at Microsoft. <a href="teaching.html">My students&rarr;</a> have a track record of proceeding to further studies and positions at top institutions and companies. Reach out if you want to work with me!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subBox">
		<img src="img/elephant-cover.png">
		<p>Supervisions are an ancient teaching system used by Cambridge and Oxford, in which students interact in very small groups (usually 2 or 3) with a subject tutor. I used to supervise many undergraduate courses at Cambridge, and wrote <a href="files/sarkar-cambridge-supervisions.html">a short book</a> about my experiences &mdash; to my knowledge, the only contemporary published account of an Oxbridge supervisor!</p>

<!--
<p>Regarding the future of humanity, I use design as a tool to probe questions such as: what is the limit of automation? How can artificial intelligence augment human capability? How should we define humanity and identity? What are the moral, ethical, and socio-economic implications of advanced artificial intelligence?</p>

<p>Regarding universal data literacy, my aim is to improve the usability and accessibility of tools for sophisticated analytics, which involves data management, statistics, and machine learning. I do this by strategically combining theories of interaction and visual representation, with artificial intelligence and machine learning, to produce novel analytics systems that are easier to use.</p> 

<p>I am also interested in live coding, computer music, psychology of programming, applied machine learning, transport research, and bibliometrics.</p>
